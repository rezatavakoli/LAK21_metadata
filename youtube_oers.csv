In this thought-provoking talk, Knoepfler readies us for the coming designer baby revolution and its very personal, and unforeseeable, consequences.

Take this course free on edX: https://www.edx.org/course/bioethics-law-medicine-ethics-harvardx-hls4x#!

ABOUT THIS COURSE
Bioethics provides an overview of the legal, medical, and ethical questions around reproduction and human genetics and how to apply legal reasoning to these questions.

This law course includes interviews with individuals who have used surrogacy and sperm donation, with medical professionals who are experts in current reproductive technologies like In Vitro Fertilization and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, and bioethicists and journalists who study the ownership and use of genetic information within human tissue. Additional Harvard colleagues will also share with you their thoughts on topics such as disability law as it relates to reproductive technology.

While the law and ethics surrounding these technologies are a central component to this course, we also show you examples of the deeply personal and human side of these issues. Throughout the course, and with the help of law students, we will discuss leading legal cases in this field, which will illuminate the types of questions the law has struggled with – stretching and evolving over time. From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years. We will also explore potential future technologies and their implications for society: genetic enhancements to increase our intelligence, let us live a hundred years longer, or make us immune to diseases – and the possibility of creating animal-human hybrids, for example a mouse with a humanized brain.

The content within this course is intended to be instructive, and show how legal reasoning has been applied, or could be applied, to questions related to parenthood, reproduction, and other issues surrounding human genetic material. The material organized within this course should be considered an authoritative overview, but is not intended to serve as medical or legal advice.

This course is designed for a diverse audience including, but not limited to, law students, prospective law students, medical professionals, as well as members of the general public interested in questions and topics related to surrogacy, parenthood, genetic and reproductive technology, ownership of genetic material, and more. You do not need any background in law, medicine, philosophy, or really any subject to enjoy this course. This course is meant to be an introduction for anyone interested in these topics.

Cancers that start in the brain are called primary brain tumours. Tumours can start in any part of the brain or related structures. Cancers that have spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body are called secondary brain tumours or brain metastases.

Generally, brain tumours can be cancerous (malignant) or non cancerous (benign).

Around half of all brain tumours, or tumours in another part of the central nervous system, are malignant. The other half are benign tumours, or tumours where the diagnosis is not known.

When the diagnosis is not known it is usually because the tumour is in a part of the brain that is too difficult to take a sample (biopsy) from. 

Having a brain tumour is relatively rare. Brain tumours that are cancerous (malignant) are more common in males than females. Non cancerous brain tumours, and tumours where the diagnosis is unknown, are more common in females.

Almost half (46%) of brain tumours in the UK each year are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over. This includes tumours in other parts of the central nervous system and tumours anywhere else inside the bones of the head.",107,67,610,4.4030685,youtube,"['brain tumour', 'brain tumour symptoms', 'brain tumour story', 'brain tumour symptom', 'brain tumour diagnosis', 'brain tumours', 'what is a brain tumour', 'help brain tumour', 'cancer brain', 'brain cancer']",Brain Tumour facts: 10 things you should know about brain tumours | Cancer Research UK,167485,brain tumors

What kinds of changes do we need to start making today to reduce our future cancer burden? Priyanka Gogna, a PhD candidate at Queen's University discusses her work as part of the ComPARe Study-a national consortium aimed at estimating the current and future burden of cancer attributable to the most important cancer risk factors for Canadians, including air pollution, red meat consumption, smoking, UV radiation, sedentary behaviour, obesity, and viruses.  Priyanka Gogna received her MSc. in Epidemiology in 2018, and is currently a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at Queen’s University under the supervision of Dr. Will King. 

Priyanka is a cancer epidemiology researcher, and studies the impact of common environmental risk factors on cancer burden at the population level. 

She is passionate about knowledge translation and the importance of disseminating cancer prevention research to the general public. She believes science is not finished until it is communicated, and tries to embody this in her everyday research. 

Aside from her academic work, she is involved in mentorship and teaching outreach programs in the Kingston community. Priyanka was the 2018 winner of the Queen’s Three Minute Thesis competition for her talk translating her molecular cancer thesis topic for the general public.

We will take a look at what they are, some terms used to describe characteristics of infectious diseases and different types. Historically, infectious diseases were the main cause of deaths around the world. Even now, they are a significant global public health issue leading to millions of deaths each year.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeSIJrmg7nU,"In the late 20th century the predominant view was that the age of infectious diseases was over, that new technologies had won the battle.  That turned out not to be the case.  This talk draws on historical and modern examples where new technologies, rather than being seen as vital additions to help fight infection, are thought to replace everything else we need to do. As a result, they have sometimes set back rather than enhanced the control of infectious diseases, at least for a time.  It is argued that this is entirely avoidable, that hugely important breakthroughs such as genetic sequencing of micro-organisms, must go hand in hand with continued action on the social and behavioural drivers of infection to achieve the greatest benefit.  Like so many aspects of modern life, the future of infectious disease control lies in essential new discoveries alongside a continued understanding of our basic humanity.

Primary Care – Weight Gain, Obesity
Whiteboard Animation Transcript
with Maja Artandi, MD
https://medskl.com/module/index/weight-gain-obesity


Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence and that is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

Obesity is defined with the help of the body mass index, or BMI calculated as Weight (kg)/Height (m²). Normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m². Overweight is defined as a BMI between 25 kg/m² and 29.9 kg/m². A patient with a BMI of 30 kg/m² and above is obese.

Obesity significantly increases the risk for many other diseases. The strongest correlation is seen between obesity and the development of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. However, a patient who is obese also has a higher likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, osteoarthritis, infertility, liver problems and even cancer.

Even though, obesity is a prevalent problem, we often don’t do a good job of counselling our patients on the importance of weight loss or the prevention of weight gain. 
The first step in obesity treatment is to identify the problem. It is important that a patient’s BMI is calculated at every visit. 

Another important way to risk stratify patients is by measuring waist circumference. The adverse consequences of obesity are most closely correlated with the accumulation of intra-abdominal fat, estimated by the waist circumference. A waist circumference in women above 88cm (35 inches) and in men above 102 cm (40 inches) is considered abnormal.

Another important part in evaluating the patient is the identification of existing co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea or severe osteoarthritis.

Counselling on weight loss should always be done on an individual basis. It is important to understand and address every patient’s barriers to weight loss rather than just giving the advice to eat fewer calories.

Pharmacologic interventions are indicated in Patients with a BMI of &gt;30 kg/m² or with a BMI of 27 kg/m² with existing comorbidities who have unsuccessfully tried to lose weight with behavioural modifications. 

It is important to realize that these medications don’t lead to drastic weight loss and only work in conjunction with dietary modifications and exercise.

It is also important to avoid medications that are known to be associated with weight gain.

Patients with a BMI above 40 kg/m² or a BMI above 35 kg/m² with existing comorbidities qualify for bariatric surgery, which is effective in moderate and severe obesity but can also have significant complications.",0,221,23,5,youtube,"['medskl.com', 'FOAMEd', 'clinical', 'animation', 'medical', 'school', 'CME']","Primary Care – Weight Gain, Obesity: By Maja Artandi M.D.",1696,obesity care

The UK's biggest and busiest NHS obesity unit opens its doors once again to allow exclusive insight into their battle with the bulge.  Sunderland Royal Hospital is at the heart of one of the fattest regions in the country and the Weight Loss Ward is like a conveyor belt with thousands of patients turning to the knife to beat their morbid obesity. With personal stories and medical insights, Weight Loss Ward confronts delicate issues head on and reveals a shocking new trend: obese people who travel abroad for low budget operations – with sometimes fatal results.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw0_dMjMekA,"It’s one of the first things checked at your doctor’s visit. “The first thing we look at is your BMI. It’s kind of how we screen people for obesity. It’s a measure of your weight divided by your height,” said Dr. Lee Coghill, a global health fellowship physician with Lee Health. 

Your body mass index, or BMI, measures the amount of fat tissue a patient has. A patient is considered overweight if they have a BMI over 30.  “We know that once you get to a certain weight, it becomes more and more difficult to lose the weight with just diet and exercise alone,” said Dr. Coghill. 

This is why doctors are having the conversation with their patients early, in hopes of preventing obesity and future health problems. “There are really strong studies that show an increase in heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and lots of different cancers with them,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Adding 20 minutes of daily exercise and subtracting high-calorie snacks can make a big difference to your weight and health. “Specifically, potato chips are one of the recognized number one things that cause increased weight gain in middle-aged men and women,” said Dr. Coghill.  

As patients age, a higher body weight means a higher risk of health problems. “Some of the modifiable risk factors are fast foods, sugary beverages, physical inactivity, child obesity, which we can combat,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Small changes to your diet and lifestyle can make big improvements to your health.

Allergies are among the most common chronic conditions. Symptoms range from a minor irritation to putting you at risk for life-threatening reactions.

“We prefer that you get to the actual underlying cause. Try to control that problem and prevent complications in the near future,” says allergist, Dr. Elvin Mendez, with Lee Memorial Health System.

Allergic reactions actually begin in your immune system when your body mistakes an otherwise harmless substance as an invader. 

“Your immune system does not recognize those particles as natural to you, so it’s mounting a response to it to try to rid of it,” says Dr. Mendez.

An allergic reaction typically triggers symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, lining of the stomach or on the skin.

The most common allergen is pollen, but other common allergens include dust mites, mold, foods, medications and insect venoms. Allergies to pets with fur are common and in the U.S., as many as three in 10 people with allergies have allergic reactions to cats and dogs.

“My eyes get puffy, itchy, I’m sneezing constantly and sometimes coughing,” complains Evan Derby.

A skin test revealed that Evan is allergic to his two dogs and his allergist recommended avoiding contact with them; but that’s not an option for Evan.

“I kind of just grin and bear it,” says Derby.

But he doesn’t have to suffer with the sniffles, there are over the counter and prescription medications to successfully combat most allergic reactions.

The first ever vaccine was created when Edward Jenner, an English physician and scientist, successfully injected small amounts of a cowpox virus into a young boy to protect him from the related (and deadly) smallpox virus. But how does this seemingly counterintuitive process work? Kelwalin Dhanasarnsombut details the science behind vaccines.

Contrary to what is sometimes presented, the idea of vaccinations did not arise as a “eureka” moment. In Jenner’s epoch, variolation, or inoculation, was practiced using smallpox scabs or pus in healthy people to protect them from what was then a terrible plague.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t57I6dNTla0,"Gary Joseph Lelli, MD, of the Department of Ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine discusses thyroid eye disease due to Graves’ disease, including which clinicians are most likely to diagnose this condition and the most common symptoms in this highly variable rare condition.

Graves' disease is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). A significant portion of persons with Graves’ disease – up to 50%  – will also have eye problems, commonly referred to as thyroid eye disease (TED).

Which Specialty Usually Diagnosis a Person with Graves’ Disease and Thyroid Eye Disease?

“Most patients are going to be seeing either a primary care doctor or an endocrinologist to make that diagnosis of Graves’ disease,” noted Dr. Lelli, adding, “although if patients have the eye findings, sometimes they come to the ophthalmologist first, or whoever their eye care provider is. They notice these eye findings and say ‘you might need to have your thyroid level checked because we're seeing certain signs and symptoms of thyroid eye disease, and then they get diagnosed that way via the endocrine or primary care doctors.”

Dr. Lelli also noted that even if a person with Graves’ disease does not have thyroid eye disease, they should be examined by an ophthalmologist to get a baseline assessment. “It's a progressive disease and it can get worse and we'd certainly like to catch these patients at the beginning and have a baseline on them,” stated Dr. Lelli, adding that if they do have thyroid eye disease, that can require treatment for the Graves’ disease to be modified. “One treatment in particular that is known to worsen thyroid eye disease is radioactive iodine and so if a patient has thyroid eye disease we want to know ahead of time so we can help our endocrinologist make a good informed decision about what the best treatment.”

Symptoms of Thyroid Eye Disease

“The most common symptom,"" according to Dr. Lelli, ""is upper eyelid retraction, which occurs in about 90% of patients with the thyroid eye disease. “What that means is the upper eyelid pulls up too high and you oftentimes will see some white over the colored part of the eye –  that's called superior scleral show,” said Dr. Lelli. 

Other symptoms can include dry eyes, inflamed, light sensitivity, and often the sensation of a foreign body present in the eye. 

Patients may also present  proptosis or exophthalmos. “All that means is that the eyeballs are pushing out too far – there is swelling behind the eyes and the eyes push out or bulge out and that will happen in about 50% of patients with thyroid eye disease.”

Another common symptom is double vision and according to Dr. Lelli, that occurs in about 40% of patients with thyroid eye disease.",0,256,14,5,youtube,,Thyroid Eye Disease: Diagnosis and Symptoms,1811,Eye Care

In the video, Dr. Vincent Gnanapragasm from Cambridge University talks us through prostate cancer symptoms, signs and types:

""As the most common cancer in men understanding Prostate Cancer is vital. So I’ve come to Cambridge University hospital to speak with Dr. Vincent Gnanapragasam to find out how they go about diagnosing this common cancer. 

Well Vincent, Prostate Cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose isn’t it. Indeed, in fact Prostate Cancer most often has no symptoms. A man might go to his GP because he has notice a change in his urinary symptoms, getting up at night maybe or having difficulty passing water. And most often that’s due to a normal enlargement of the prostate as he gets older. In fact prostate cancer doesn’t cause any symptoms unless it is very advanced. In which case it might mimic some of those symptoms of an obstructed or large prostate. But if there are any concerns the first step is to go and see your GP who can then investigate further. 

What would your GP do?

- Take a history
- Do a physical examination
- PSA blood test

So what would your GP do? Most often they’ll take a history from you, do an examination of the prostate and do a PSA blood test. What is a PSA test? So PSA stand for Prostate Specific Antigene. It’s produced by the prostate gland and it’s a marker for the presence of Prostate Cancer. However it can also be raised by other conditions so it’s not a very specific marker but it’s the first test that we can do to see whether we should proceed to further investigations.

What is a PSA test? A blood test that measures the amount of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in your blood.

So what happens if you get sent to the hospital for an examination? The specialist will see you, again take a history and an examination and then most often what they will do is arrange a prostate biopsy. Increasingly they might recommend a scan to be done first, an MRI scan and then discuss with you what the best way to do a biopsy is. 

What is a Biopsy? The removal of a small sample of tissue for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease.

And if it is cancer tell us what happens then, tell us about some of the tests. Well, a discussion then starts. The first step is to make sure we know exactly what kind of Cancer it is and that might involve other types of scans, for example a CT scan or a bone scan. The kind of Cancer is determined by the size of it or the stage of a cancer. And once the specialist puts all that information together with what the biopsy has shown then they start to discuss with you what the treatments are.""",108,153,1016,4.6156583,youtube,"['prostate cancer', 'diagnosing cancer', 'difficulty passing urine', 'prostate', 'advanced cancer', 'cancer examination', 'PSA test', 'prostate-specific antigen', 'biopsy', 'bone scan', 'prostate cancer signs', 'prostate check', 'prostate biopsy']",What are the Signs and Symptoms of Prostate Cancer? | Cancer Research UK,325365,prostate cancer

This video explains what treatments are available for prostate cancer and the factors that determine what treatment a person might have. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK so it's important to know the facts.

Dr. Vincent Gnanapragasm from Cambridge University talks us through prostate cancer treatments: 

Over 80% of men live for 10 or more years after a diagnosis of Prostate Cancer. I’ve come to Cambridge university hospital to speak with Dr. Vincent Gnanapragasam about some of the treatments that are available for this type of Cancer. So Vincent what are the important factors when deciding what type of treatment a person should have?

The treatment options for Prostate Cancer are very much dependent on what type of cancer an individual has and also the patient themselves. So if a cancer is confined to within the prostate gland then we might be able to treat it with surgery or radiotherapy, but equally there might be a very slow growing tumour which we can just keep an eye on that. But the kind of cancer is determined by the size of it or the stage of a cancer, the type of cancer it is or the grade and also the PSA test. Now we use those 3 put together to create an idea of the risk of a particular individual dying of prostate cancer. 

What treatments are available? In general there is surgery to remove the prostate gland, radiotherapy where you deliver high intensity radiation beams or surveillance where we can monitor or just check on someone and defer treatment until later. So a number of different options then Vincent but how do you decide what one is best? That decision is left to the patient in consultation with his consultant or his nurse specialist and comes down to whether the patient feels that a particular type of treatment is best suited for their lifestyle and also the risks and side effects which may come about from that.

And what happens when treatment is finished? After treatment is finished the patient enters a phase of very close monitoring and where they’ll be seen regularly in hospital often with a PSA test being done  on a regular interval. What about for treatment of cancers that have been spread? When a cancer has spread beyond a prostate then the most common treatment is hormonal therapy and that serves to keep the cancer under control and many men can live for many years with that and if that should fail there are actually other drugs that can be used, chemotherapies which again can be very effective.

Dealing with cancer is never easy and this is especially so when deciding about treatments. But of course it helps if you know the facts.

Transcript of the video:

Prostate Cancer Stages

I'm doing this video because one of my close relatives was recently diagnosed, and when that happened I wanted to learn as much as I could about prostate cancer. I did a lot of research, using only reliable websites like the ones you see on your screen, and I'll summarize what I learned about prostate cancer stages in the next minute or so.

Prostate cancer stages indicate how far the cancer has progressed. A lower stage means cancer cells are confined to the prostate. A higher stage is assigned when the cancer has grown to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant areas of the body.

Prostate cancer usually grows slowly and in the beginning, confines itself to the prostate gland. Some types of prostate cancer may not even need to be treated, depending on the age of the patient. But other types are more aggressive, can spread quickly, and require treatment.

There are four stages.

Stage I. At this stage, the cancer is located only in a small area of the prostate. 

Stage II. Cancer cells may still be small but could possibly be aggressive, depending on the type. Stage II could also, however, include a larger area that ha grown to involve both sides of the prostate gland.

Stage III. At this stage, the cancer has spread beyond the prostate to nearby tissues.

Stage IV. The cancer is invading nearby tissues, bones or organs, which may include the bladder, lymph nodes, or even those as far away as the lungs.

Your doctor assigns your cancer a stage after testing. Of course, cancer in the early stages, when it's still confined to the prostate, has a better chance of successful treatment and a longer survival rate.

I've produced several other videos on prostate cancer, including one on survival rates. You'll find links to those videos above",3,106,50,4.7735848,youtube,"['Prostate', 'Cancer', 'Stages']",Prostate Cancer Stages,14018,prostate cancer

SUMMARY:
- If you want to learn if someone has been looking at you, try yawning. No, it’s not some secret code, but if someone is looking at you and you happen to yawn, they won’t be able to help but yawn themselves. 
- The food serves as a great distraction and can actually relieve tension since you’ll start to care more about the food than what you’re talking about.
- When there’s silence, the other person is more likely to talk and will probably say more than they would if you were to interject. 
- A sure way to stand out from the crowd is to use the “serial position effect.” This is based on the idea that people tend to remember the first and last parts of things and not as much of the middle.
- If you’re in a new relationship or starting a friendship with someone, instead of going to the movies or out to eat, try doing an activity together that can get your blood pumping.
- While you’re talking and getting to know each other, try to point out something you both have in common. Maybe you grew up in the same town or you both have the same alma mater.
- When you meet someone for the first time at a party or work event, say their name right after they introduce themselves.
- Instead of asking the person point blank if they can help, pose a false dilemma. 
- Even if you aren’t sure of something, that doesn’t mean you should question what you say. Try leaving out the word “I think” when you talk to your friends and family. 
- For people to pay attention to what you’re saying, keep direct eye contact with them while you’re talking.

SUMMARY
- If a person is talking to you and closing their eyes, you should know that they’re trying to hide from the outside world. 
- A few fingers, a palm, or even a fist near the mouth helps us hold back the words we don't want to let out. 
- If you see someone chewing on the earpieces of their glasses, try having a heart-to-heart with them and cheering them up. They’re definitely subconsciously worried about something. 
- Crossed arms are a clear sign that a person is not feeling it today. 
- When a woman wants a man to notice her, she tries to present herself in the best way possible. She straightens her back to emphasize her breasts, and she may also cross her legs. 
- When people like someone and want to get to know them, they usually lean forward. 
- If someone sits back in their chair, they’re showing that they’re tired of the conversation and don't want to keep it going. 
- If a person doesn't swing back and forth but bounces up and down on their toes, it might be a sign that they’re feeling confident. 
- Rubbing the hands together generally means that a person has a positive feeling about something, and they’re hopeful. 
- While you’re shaking hands with someone, if that person takes your wrist with their free hand, they’re showing that they’re trustworthy, friendly, and honest.

Upon meeting someone for the first time, it can be hard to work out what kind of person they are. That’s why reading people helps you understand them more accurately. The cues are always there, you just need to look for them!

Your ability to read people on sight will affect how you deal with them. Thus, the more accurately you read them, the more effective your communication will be. So, if you want to read people, you need to pay attention to everything. From someone’s eye contact to their smile, from their head movements to their posture, down to their shoes.

While reading people or their body language isn’t easy, if you can do it, it’s a great skill to have. Of course, everyone is different, so your interpretation of them may or may not always be accurate. But, if you want to know more about how to read anyone instantly, definitely give these psychological tips a go!

Psychiatry – Sleep Disorders
Whiteboard Animation Transcript
with Elliott Lee, MD
https://medskl.com/Course/Detail/psychiatry

Sleep problems can be divided into complaints that people have:

1. One of the most common complaints is excessive daytime sleepiness. There are generally 5 major causes for excessive daytime sleepiness…

…the most common of which is an insufficient quantity of sleep. Many medical students suffer from this!

Next is a poor quality of sleep. Environmental disturbances (such as light, partner, pet), or other intrinsic sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder could be involved. 

Thirdly, and less common, is a pathologic disorder of sleepiness during the day, including narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. 

Fourthly, a medical or psychiatric disorder, such as a thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effect, or mood disorder can present with sleepiness.

Finally, a circadian rhythm disorder such as shift work, or jet lag could also be a culprit.

2. On the other hand, sometimes patients complain of difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, or “insomnia”. This symptom can be a primary disorder on its own, but is usually the result of, or exacerbated by one or a combination of four factors: 

An acute stressor. This is a common culprit in many cases of insomnia, but often is comorbid with other factors 

Circadian rhythm issue – including shift work or a circadian rhythm disorder 

A medical or neurologic condition – common culprits include medications or substances such as caffeine, alcohol, a thyroid problem, or other potential medical disorders, and 

A psychiatric condition, especially mood or anxiety disorders.

3. Lastly, another presentation could be an unusual behavior at night. This is referred to as a parasomnia, or disorder of arousal. These are often classified according to what stage of sleep they emerge from:

NREM sleep parasomnias typically include sleepwalking, or night terrors, 

While the classic REM parasomnia is REM behavior disorder, where patients act out their dreams.",12,154,167,4.7318435,youtube,"['medskl.com', 'FOAMEd', 'clinical', 'animation', 'medical', 'school', 'CME']",Psychiatry – Sleep Disorders: By Elliott Lee M.D.,19353,sleep disorder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OvIFN6Gr9c,"Circadian rhythm sleep disorders can account for many sleep problems.  There are many people who have an irregular body clock and they just don’t know it.  Circadian rhythm sleep disorders occur when there is a mismatch between the sleep-wake cycle required by your environment and your own internal sleep wake cycle.

There are 5 main types of circadian rhythm disorders.  They are delayed phase sleep disorder, advanced phase sleep disorder, Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder, shift work and jet lag. 

Delayed phase sleep disorder occurs when you can’t seem to get sleepy until very late in the evening – typically between 1am and 6am.  This is despite your best efforts to settle down and get to bed hours earlier.   And because you feel asleep late, you are are naturally driven to sleep until late morning or early afternoon.

Sleeping late becomes a problem when you have an inflexible morning schedule.  Let’s say you have to wake up at 6am to go to work so you can’t afford to be awake at 2am.  For those who have flexible schedules, they can simply sleep later and end up getting a full 7-9 hours of sleep.  

There is an adolescent version of this that is usually hormonally driven and seen in about 10% of teenagers.  It’s tough when they are trying to get up to go to school, but they often grow out of it by early 20’s.

People with advanced phase sleep disorder have the opposite problem. They have trouble keeping her eyes open early in the evening and want to go to sleep between 6 and 8pm. This tends to be less disruptive a problem for the person who has a 9-to-5 job. But here is where it can cause problems:   you get home from work and fall asleep on the couch at 7pm and wake up at 11pm.  You then can’t go back to sleep until 2 AM and sleep until 5am. Cumulatively you’ve gotten seven hours of sleep. But you still don’t feel rested because your sleep is choppy and your natural progression and flow of your sleep cycle was interrupted.  

Then we have the non-24-hour sleep wake disorder.  For this person, their body clock is longer than 24 hrs, lets just say 25hr.  So what happens is they naturally go to sleep later and later each night.  Eventually they have complete day-night reversal.  This sleep disorder is more commonly seen in people who are blind, but does occur is sighted people as well.  It tends to be very debilitating as the person has no reliable or consistent sleep pattern.

I will talk about solutions to these problems in a later videos.  I will talk about shift work and jet lag in the lifestyle interference video, but just know that they are classified as circadian rhythm disorders.

""I was falling asleep, pulling up to stop lights and I was partially dozing off.""
 
And knew something was wrong.
 
""Wasn't feeling well, was tired all the time...""
 
He kept nodding off during the day and waking up at night.
 
""Gasping for air, my chest was pounding and everything.""
 
Specialists say sleep disorders fall into two categories:
 
""One is when you're trying to sleep and you can't get a good quality sleep which is sleep-related breathing disorders. And then on the other end is poor choices, which is habit,"" says Dr. Javaad Khan Sleep Specialist with Lee Memorial Health System.
 
It's thought millions of people are affected by sleep disorders, but as many as 95% may be undiagnosed. People might feel bad enough to go to their primary physician, but fail to mention their troubled sleep.
 
In those cases, sleep is the issue, and lack of sleep can damage your health.
 
""Neurologically you can have impaired concentration, it can cause stroke, heart disease, poorly controlled blood pressure it can cause different types of arrhythmias it can cause impaired glucose control,"" says Dr. Khan.
 
One night in a sleep lab confirmed Milt had sleep apnea, which stopped his breathing. Lifestyle choices can make it worse.
 
""If you're an active smoker, it goes up by a factor of three. Alcohol worsens sleep apnea. And then diet and weight,"" says Dr. Khan.
 
Finding the source of his restlessness put Milt's mind and body at ease.

Why do women feel flat despite eating well and working out the same way as their male colleagues?  The answer lies in gender bias. 

Historically, sports nutrition studies were conducted on men and the results assumed to be the same for women. Stacy explains why this this presumption is not correct. Her talk will empower us all to ask questions of the sports nutrition status quo.

Hey, my name is Erin, and I'm a former US Junior Olympic certified swim coach and personal trainer, and fitness is my passion so I cannot wait to share it with you guys. All right, diet and nutrition tips for women. Your workout really isn't gonna make a difference if your diet is not clean. So you're putting in all this effort at the gym or at home or in the pool or wherever it may be, doing our videos, and that's all great, but you're not going to see the results if your diet is not clean. You need to keep a healthy, rested, hydrated body, free of garbage and chemicals as much as possible. You don't have to be perfect, but just try and make small changes, because small changes over time do add up. The first thing that I always stress is water. Water, water everywhere. Seriously, you need to drink at least half of your body weight in ounces of water each day. Another component of clean eating is making sure that your food is literally clean. We're fortunate that in this day and age, organic health food stores are springing up all over the place and that sort of access to that is easier than it has been in the past. If organic is not available to you, or it's too expensive, that's fine, just try to go for hormone and antibiotic free. Because what you don't want is you don't want to be consuming tons of protein to try and build this muscle mass, at the same time consuming antibiotics and growth hormones and all sorts of other garbage that unfortunately is in a lot of lower quality meat. You really just want to stay as close to nature as possible. That's the key to clean eating. And then last but not least, it's really important to enjoy yourself. So you should enjoy your food, you should pay attention to what you're eating, how you're eating it, when you're eating it, and how you feel when you're consuming your food. Because at the end of the day, consuming food should be pleasurable, but it should also be nourishing. And so the best way to know if something's good for you or not is just listening to your body. How many times do we eat, I don't know, a large burrito from a fast food chain let's say, and two hours later you're like 'Oh my god, I can't believe I just did that!' Part of it is because, you just don't feel good. You feel slow, weighed down, or gassy, or whatever it may be. It's fine to indulge, but just indulge wisely. Do it in moderation, don't do it all the time. Don't freak out if you fall off, that's the worst thing you could do. You know, a donut is not gonna kill you. It's really, really pretty simple and straightforward. Most important is keep it clean, drink tons of water, and listen to your body.",249,175,955,4.1727576,youtube,"['diet tips', 'erin sharoni', 'exercise plan', 'exercise programs', 'fitness', 'fitness for women', 'fitness workout', 'nutrition tips', 'strength conditioning', 'strength training', 'work out', 'workout plan', 'workout routine', 'workout routines', 'workouts']",8 Diet & Nutrition Tips | Female Bodybuilding,179809,women and nutrition

Follow these nutritional guidelines for women to lower your risk of disease and cancer.

Step 1: Obtain calorie intake
Obtain your recommended calorie intake by going to mypyramid.gov. Calorie amounts depend on age, sex, and activity level. A good rule of thumb is 13 calories per pound of body weight for a sedentary person of either sex, 16 calories per pound for a moderately active person, and 18 calories per pound for a vigorously active person.

Step 2: Add carbohydrates into diet
Reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease by adding complex carbohydrates that are found in high-fiber and unrefined foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole-grain products, and legumes.

Tip
Women should get 25 grams of fiber a day before the age of 50 and 21 grams a day after age 50.

Step 3: Acquire calcium
Get 1,000 milligrams of calcium up to the age of 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50. Getting sufficient calcium is effective for reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, reducing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, preventing stroke, and treating osteoporosis.

Step 4: Attain iron
Get 18 milligrams of iron if you are between 19 to 50 years of age, 8 milligrams for 51 and older, and 27 milligrams if you are pregnant. Dried beans, fortified cereals, pasta, beef, and poultry are foods high in iron.

Step 5: Get vitamin D
Go outside to get 5 to 20 minutes of exposure to the sun a week, or eat foods such as fish, eggs, milk, and cod liver to get your daily recommended amount of vitamin D. Women need 200 international units under the age of 50 and 400 international units for ages 51 and older.

Step 6: Limit fats in diet
Maintain a diet with a fat consumption below 30 percent of your daily calories. Avoid foods high in saturated and trans fat such as margarine, palm oil, fried foods, and commercial baked goods. Incorporating monounsaturated fats such as salmon and olive oil into your diet is healthy for your heart.

Tip
Ask you doctor about taking a multivitamin if you're worried about fitting the recommended daily amounts into your diet.

Step 7: Include 60 grams of protein
Include 60 grams of protein -- the amount in about 6 ounces of chicken -- into your daily diet. Too much protein can raise your risk of osteoporosis and calcium loss in your urine. Stay healthy by staying within these guidelines.

Did You Know?
Iron functions primarily as a carrier of oxygen in the body, but it also aids in immune function, cognitive development, and temperature regulation.",2,184,25,4.7037039,youtube,"['vitamins', 'supplements', 'follow', 'nutrition', 'guidelines', 'women', 'health', 'diet', 'doctor', 'calories']",How to Follow Nutrition Guidelines for Women's Health,6231,women and nutrition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcL86Lv_jsQ,"Combining the CrossFit training methodology with a diet of meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar brings ""a jet stream of adaptation,"" says CrossFit founder Greg Glassman.

In the pyramid Glassman created, nutrition is the foundation, with met-cons, gymnastics, weightlifting and throwing, and sport following.

""Each level builds on the level below it,"" explains Nicole Carroll, director of certification. ""If your nutrition sucks, these things will not be where they could be if it were more solid.""

Likewise, Glassman says CrossFit favors Barry Sears' Zone Diet ""because it does give me accurate and precise prescription for caloric intake and, more importantly, the exact levels of macronutrient that I can start at.""

Likewise, trainers and coaches can make informed decisions on how to tweak an athlete's diet for improved performance, he says.

CrossFit HQ trainer Pat Sherwood says nutrition isn't an either/or aspect of training.

""It's not quality or quantity. It can and it should be both.""

Healthy Eating for Perimenopause & Menopause

For women after the age of 40 years of age, the physical and emotional changes due to perimenopause can be a big challenge negatively influencing energy, mood, weight and long-term chronic disease risk. The good news is that slight shifts to your diet can positively help you manage perimenopause and menopause symptoms to help you look and feel your best.

What are the major issues for women in perimenopause and menopause?

As hormone levels change in menopause it is common for women to experience:

    Lowered energy levels and fatigue
    Mood swings (such as depression, anxiety)
    Lowered bone density and increased risk of osteoporosis
    Increased risk of heart disease
    Sleep disruption
    Weight gain

What should women eat to help improve their symptoms at menopause?

The top 5 nutrition considerations for women at menopause:

    Meals that combine carbohydrates AND protein
    A focus on REAL food
    Gradually decrease calorie intake
    Get enough calcium and vitamin D
    Take a vitamin B12 supplement

These 5 nutrition tips for menopause are described in the link at the top.

ID#: ANH12071

Transcript:
Every time you smoke a cigarette, toxic gases pass into your lungs, then into your bloodstream, where they spread to every organ in your body. A cigarette is made using the tobacco leaf, which contains nicotine and a variety of other compounds. As the tobacco and compounds burn, they release thousands of dangerous chemicals, including over forty known to cause cancer. Cigarette smoke contains the poisonous gases carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, as well as trace amounts of cancer-causing radioactive particles. All forms of tobacco are dangerous, including cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff. 

Nicotine is an addictive chemical in tobacco. Smoking causes death. People who smoke typically die at an earlier age than non-smokers. In fact, 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States is linked to cigarette smoking.

If you smoke, your risk for major health problems increases dramatically, including: heart disease, heart attack, stroke, lung cancer, and death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Smoking causes cardiovascular disease.  

When nicotine flows through your adrenal glands, it stimulates the release of epinephrine, a hormone that raises your blood pressure. In addition, nicotine and carbon monoxide can damage the lining of the inner walls in your arteries. Fatty deposits, called plaque, can build up at these injury sites and become large enough to narrow the arteries and severely reduce blood flow, resulting in a condition called atherosclerosis. In coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis narrows the arteries that supply the heart, which reduces the supply of oxygen to your heart muscle, increasing your risk for a heart attack. Smoking also raises your risk for blood clots because it causes platelets in your blood to clump together. Smoking increases your risk for peripheral vascular disease, in which atherosclerotic plaques block the large arteries in your arms and legs. Smoking can also cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a swelling or weakening of your aorta where it runs through your abdomen.

Smoking damages two main parts of your lungs: your airways, also called bronchial tubes, and small air sacs called alveoli. Cigarette smoke irritates the lining of your bronchial tubes, causing them to swell and make mucus. Cigarette smoke also slows the movement of your cilia, causing some of the smoke and mucus to stay in your lungs. While you are sleeping, some of the cilia recover and start pushing more pollutants and mucus out of your lungs. When you wake up, your body attempts to expel this material by coughing repeatedly, a condition known as smoker's cough. Over time, chronic bronchitis develops as your cilia stop working, your airways become clogged with scars and mucus, and breathing becomes difficult.

Your lungs are now more vulnerable to further disease. Cigarette smoke also damages your alveoli, making it harder for oxygen and carbon dioxide to exchange with your blood. Over time, so little oxygen can reach your blood that you may develop emphysema, a condition in which you must gasp for every breath and wear an oxygen tube under your nose in order to breathe.

Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are collectively called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a gradual loss of the ability to breathe for which there is no cure. 

Cigarette smoke contains at least 40 cancer-causing substances, called carcinogens, including cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and ammonia. In your body, healthy cells grow, make new cells, then die. Genetic material inside each cell, called DNA, directs this process. If you smoke, toxic chemicals can damage the DNA in your healthy cells. As a result, your damaged cells create new unhealthy cells, which grow out of control and may spread to other parts of your body. Cigarettes can cause cancer in other parts of your body, such as: in the blood and bone marrow, mouth, larynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, uterus, and cervix.

Smoking can cause infertility in both men and women. If a woman is pregnant and smokes during pregnancy, she exposes her baby to the cigarette's poisonous chemicals, causing a greater risk of: low birth weight, miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, infant death, and sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking is also dangerous if a mother is breastfeeding. Nicotine passes to the baby through breast milk, and can cause restlessness, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, interrupted sleep, or diarrhea. 

Other health effects of smoking include: low bone density and increased risk for hip fracture among women; gum disease, often leading to tooth loss and surgery; immune system dysfunction and delayed wound healing; and sexual impotence in men.",879,538,17224,4.805778,youtube,"['3d', 'animation', 'medical', 'health', 'smoking', 'nicotine', 'emphysema', 'copd', 'cancer', 'malignant', 'trachea', 'cigarette', 'cigar', 'pipe', 'addiction', 'alveoli', 'aneurysm', 'cough', 'mucus', 'bronchitis', 'atherosclerosis', 'cardiovascular', 'pulmonary', 'disease', 'complications', 'heart', 'arteries', 'vessels', 'veins', 'clots', 'aortic', 'oxygen', 'carbon monoxide', 'coronary', 'obstructive', 'neuron', 'tobacco', 'plaque', 'marijuana', 'nucleus medical media', 'lungs', 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Disease Or Medical Condition)', 'Cardiovascular Disease (Disease Or Medical Condition)']","Smoking Causes Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema",2102409,smoking health risks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD__r66sFjk,"This shows smoking a pack a day for 30 days! That's 600 cigarettes!  The average American smoker smokes a pack a day. This is what could be going in your lungs. 

● same experiment SMOKING only one Cigarette    https://youtu.be/YS02MCx9f2c
● same experiment SMOKING 1 pack of Cigarettes a Day    https://youtu.be/AQwIDiL8gOM
● same experiment SMOKING vs VAPING for a Month       https://youtu.be/0Pwj6BuS8Ds

------------------ EXPLANATION of the test --------------------------

* This is not a scientific test. Visually shows what is going in your lungs

* The average American smoker smokes one pack a day = 30 packs a month (Google)

* 30 packs x 20 per pack = 600 cigarettes.

* The smoke was not held. Exhale hose clearly shown at 0:15

* if all the smoke had been blown back through the cotton, like real smoking, the results would have been even worse!

* The smoke was drawn through and around the cotton, catching some, not all, of the chemicals and tar, evident by the accumulation in the hoses. 

* The machine smoked each cigarette at the same pace.  

* Each cigarette was smoked 3/4 of the way to reflect real world smoking allowing a quarter of it to just burn away while talking or thinking.

* It took 3 days for the machine to smoke all of the cigarettes.
 
* The chamber was cleared of smoke between each and every cigarette allowing air to enter. 

* Scenes were sped up and time lapsed to be able to see the visual change in colour occur.
 
* The black stuff is called tar. Heavy accumulation of tar in the hoses showed up after only 10 packs. Tar from the next 20 packs overflowed and got sucked into the pump. It eventually ruined the pump.

* Lungs do self clean to take care of dust and debris from normal breathing in the environment.  They weren't meant to be overwhelmed on an hourly basis by smoke from a burning object for life.

* The smell inside the dome at the end was vile. I felt quite ill afterwards. Can't imagine how a smoker feels on a daily basis. 

* I think everyone agrees we must do our part to give kids a good start in life and do our best to prevent youngsters from taking up these very poor habits including vaping. If you are one of those people that smokes tobacco, cannabis or vapes, never let children or kids see you do it. If kids see an adult doing it, they think it's ok. If you must do it, make sure you are out of sight at home, near schools, around arenas or at parks. Do your part to help everyone raise healthy kids!

* just remember this one simple rule and you can't go wrong...."".your lungs were only meant for one thing and that's air""

• More women die from lung cancer each year than from breast cancer.
• Smoking causes about 80% (or 8 out of 10) of all deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
• Smoking and Increased Health Risks
• Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer.
• Estimates show smoking increases the risk:
• For coronary heart disease by 2 to 4 times
• For stroke by 2 to 4 times
• Of men developing lung cancer by 25 times
• Of women developing lung cancer by 25.7 times
• Smoking causes diminished overall health, increased absenteeism from work, and increased health care utilization and cost.
• 
• Smokers are at greater risk for diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease).
• 
• Smoking causes stroke and coronary heart disease, which are among the leading causes of death in the United States.
• Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can have early signs of cardiovascular disease.
• Smoking damages blood vessels and can make them thicken and grow narrower. 
• This makes your heart beat faster and your blood pressure go up. Clots can also form.
• Smoking can cause lung disease by damaging your airways and the small air sacs (alveoli) found in your lungs.

• Lung diseases caused by smoking include COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
• Cigarette smoking causes most cases of lung cancer.
• If you have asthma, tobacco smoke can trigger an attack or make an attack worse.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gX-TcHtDg,"Smoking cigarettes cause toxic gases to enter into our body through the lungs and the bloodstream.  Cigarettes contain cancer-causing compounds such as nicotine and carbon monoxide. 
Major health effects include death, increasing your risk from diseases such as heart diseases, heart attack, lung cancer and stroke. Smoking causes cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and many other major health problems.  It also damages the windpipe and bronchioles in the lungs, adversely affecting our breathing abilities. 
Carcinogens present in cigarettes such as nicotine, cyanide, formaldehyde etc. cause different types of cancer. 

The video begins by explaining how the smoke enters first into our lungs and then into the blood stream through which it enters into every organ of the body. Chemicals like Nictotine enters into the body which induces pleasurble feeling making a person addictive to that. It moves on to explain the harmful effects of smoking and also how it causes cancer. Manipal Hospitals is a certified pioneer in the Indian health-care industry for over 6 decades and has been delivering state-of-the-art health-care services that are curative, preventive and rehabilitative.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bla7HcTH0AE,"Yoga websites list a multitude of benefits for the Sun Salutation, just for example (or google yourself, if you can't believe it, either): Strengthens the entire digestive system (including stomach, pancreas, intestines, liver, etc.) and cures, and prevents constipation. Invigorates the heart and will cure and prevent blood pressure, palpitation. Develops the lungs, gives you wind and prevents tuberculosis. Will remove kidney troubles. Makes you immune from disease by tremendously increasing your disease-resisting power. Will keep you away from sins. Helps lose weight. Gives glowing skin. Ensures regular menstrual cycle. Brings down blood sugar levels.

While I cannot promise these benefits (as I am a down to earth person with a science degree), I can promise you deep insights into the flexion-extension cycles that make up the sun salutation. You will be able to perform these way more profoundly than any other yoga guru, and you will feel yourself better, YOU will feel better. I also hope to arouse your curiosity in experimenting with these positions.

Somatic education is a field within bodywork and movement studies which emphasizes internal physical perception and experience. The term is used in movement therapy to signify approaches based on the soma, or ""the body as perceived from within,"" including Alexander technique, the Feldenkrais Method, and Rolfing. In dance, the term refers to techniques based on the dancer's internal sensation, in contrast with ""performative techniques"".

This is my series of videos with beginner lessons of the Feldenkrais Method of Somatic Education. This will give everyone with an Internet connection the chance to get to know the Feldenkrais Method, to learn more about awareness, mindfulness, how to take care of one's own health, and to become better day by day.

I recommend to work through the videos one by one, in the correct order, starting here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA2509fpoqE&list=PLcGwQrrRmOBCHy9Zlj-03wKE-s5ZCcZyV&index=1

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data  these computer programs are enabled to learn  grow  change  and develop by themselves. So  to put simply  the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. Now  let us get started with this Machine Learning tutorial video and understand what it is and why it matters.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU,"This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning  what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised  unsupervised & reinforcement learning  how Machine Learning works with simple examples  and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data  these computer programs are enabled to learn  grow  change  and develop by themselves. So  put simply  the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live  and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now  let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

And in this class  you learn about the state of the art and also gain practice implementing and deploying these algorithms yourself. You've probably use a learning algorithm dozens of times a day without knowing it. Every time you use a web search engine like Google or Bing to search the internet  one of the reasons that works so well is because a learning algorithm  one implemented by Google or Microsoft  has learned how to rank web pages. Every time you use Facebook or Apple's photo typing application and it recognizes your friends' photos  that's also machine learning. Every time you read your email and your spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam email  that's also a learning algorithm.

Each python machine learning project I discuss has a corresponding dataset that can be found below. As a beginner data scientist I always recommend learning the basics first and then moving into more advanced models and techniques. That is why I recommend starting with linear regression moving to K-Nearest-Neighbors  Using SVM's and finally trying Neural Networks.

Explore the full course on Udemy (special discount included in the link): https://bit.ly/2SxoeBM

In less than 3 hours  you can understand the theory behind modern artificial intelligence  and apply it with several hands-on examples. This is machine learning on steroids! Find out why everyone’s so excited about it and how it really works – and what modern AI can and cannot really do.

In this course  we will cover:

•        Deep Learning Pre-requistes (gradient descent  autodiff  softmax)
•        The History of Artificial Neural Networks
•        Deep Learning in the Tensorflow Playground
•        Deep Learning Details
•        Introducing Tensorflow
•        Using Tensorflow
•        Introducing Keras
•        Using Keras to Predict Political Parties
•        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
•        Using CNNs for Handwriting Recognition
•        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
•        Using a RNN for Sentiment Analysis
•        The Ethics of Deep Learning
•        Learning More about Deep Learning

At the end  you will have a final challenge to create your own deep learning / machine learning system to predict whether real mammogram results are benign or malignant  using your own artificial neural network you have learned to code from scratch with Python.

Separate the reality of modern AI from the hype – by learning about deep learning  well  deeply. You will need some familiarity with Python and linear algebra to follow along  but if you have that experience  you will find that neural networks are not as complicated as they sound. And how they actually work is quite elegant!

This is hands-on tutorial with real code you can download  study  and run yourself.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJJc1t0rtSU,"In this intermediate deep learning tutorial  you will learn how to go from reading a paper on deep deterministic policy gradients to implementing the concepts in Tensorflow. This process can be applied to any deep learning paper  not just deep reinforcement learning.

In the second part  you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch  to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).

DDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy  coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency  as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.

In this third video about SPSS for Beginners  Dr. Daniel shows you three ways to approach descriptive statistics in SPSS. If you want quick and basic descriptives  use the Descriptives command to get the most commonly used statistics. The Frequencies command gives you a wide range of possibilities with the most flexibility to choose exactly what output that you want. When you want maximum output with lots of graphs – or if you want to split the descriptive statistics by a categorical variable (like gender)  then use the Explore command.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49fADBfcDD4,"The R programming language is experiencing rapid increases in popularity and wide adoption across industries. This popularity is due  in part  to R’s rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel  Power BI  and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations  none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of  and control over  crafted data visualizations.  

As an example  R’s ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations – where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this webinar we will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

Attendees will learn how to: 

• Craft ggplot visualizations  including customization of rendered output. 

• Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 

• Leverage ggplot2’s powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve “visual drill-in of data”. 

• Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

Danielle Albers Szafir  assistant professor of information science and affiliate professor of computer and cognitive science  University of Colorado Boulder

Danielle Albers Szafir’s research sits at the intersection of information visualization  data science  computer graphics  and cognitive science. Along with a team of fantastic students and collaborators  she looks at the relationship between cognition and visualization design. Through this process  she develops interactive visualization systems  guidelines  and techniques for exploring large  complex data. This work has inspired collaborations across a variety of domains including genomics  bioinformatics  the humanities  biochemistry  and perceptual psychology.

The Next in Science series allows early-career scientists whose creative  cross-disciplinary research is thematically linked to introduce their work to one another  to fellow scientists  and to nonspecialists from Harvard and the Greater Boston area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXjPcXx42Yc,"The R programming language is experiencing rapid increases in popularity and wide adoption across industries. This popularity is due  in part  to R’s rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel  Power BI  and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations  none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of  and control over  crafted data visualizations. 

As an example  R’s ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations – where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this webinar Arham Akheel will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

Attendees will learn how to: 

• Craft ggplot visualizations  including customization of rendered output. 

• Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 

• Leverage ggplot2’s powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve “visual drill-in of data”. 

• Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia  ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.""

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago  with increasing amount and complexity of data  these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing  handling  evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes  and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer  to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect  and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life  then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Hadoop and its associated distributions from Hortonworks  Cloudera and MapR include a dizzying array of technologies. We will start talking about the origins and history of Hadoop  and then take a look at how all the different open-source systems that surround Hadoop clusters fit together. After this video  you will have a high level overview of the biggest systems in the world of Hadoop today and see how they interoperate. 

Apache projects tend to have cryptic names  and we will decipher what they all really do. We will talk briefly about the core components of Hadoop: HDFS  YARN  and MapReduce. And then we will touch upon all the other systems  built up around them  including Apache Spark  Hive  Pig  Ambari  Oozie  Zookeeper  Sqoop  Flume  Kafka  Mesos  HBase  Storm  Hue  Presto  Zeppelin  MySQL  Cassandra  MongoDB  Drill  and Phoenix. 

My larger course covers each technology in more depth  but at the end of this video  these terms should at least make sense to you and you will be less confused when people talk about them all. 

Course Description
The world of Hadoop and ""Big Data"" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course  you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!

Learn and master the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course  taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We'll go way beyond Hadoop itself  and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.

Install and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks and the Ambari UI
Manage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce
Write programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark
Store and query your data with Sqoop  Hive  MySQL  HBase  Cassandra  MongoDB  Drill  Phoenix  and Presto
Design real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem
Learn how your cluster is managed with YARN  Mesos  Zookeeper  Oozie  Zeppelin  and Hue
Handle streaming data in real time with Kafka  Flume  Spark Streaming  Flink  and Storm
Understanding Hadoop is a highly valuable skill for anyone working at companies with large amounts of data.

Almost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way  including Amazon  Ebay  Facebook  Google  LinkedIn  IBM   Spotify  Twitter  and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New York Times uses Hadoop for processing images.

This course is comprehensive  covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises  so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.

You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords  there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines  we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer  I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala  Pig Latin  and Python.

You'll walk away from this course with a real  deep understanding of Hadoop and its associated distributed systems  and you can apply Hadoop to real-world problems. Plus a valuable completion certificate is waiting for you at the end! 

Please note the focus on this course is on application development  not Hadoop administration. Although you will pick up some administration skills along the way.

I hope to see you in the course soon!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia  ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.""

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago  with increasing amount and complexity of data  these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing  handling  evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes  and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer  to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect  and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life  then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia  ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms  Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However  it is becoming very difficult for companies to store  retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well  nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago  with increasing amount and complexity of data  these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing  handling  evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes  and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer  to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect  and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life  then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOwlXUaGMM,"What is Big Data (2018)? (In 5 mins)

Big Data basically refers to  huge volume of data that cannot be  stored and processed using the traditional approach within the given time frame.

The next big question that comes to our mind is?
How huge this data needs to be? In order to be classified as Big Data?
There is a lot of misconception  while referring the term Big Data.
We usually use the term big data  to refer to the data  that is  either in gigabytes or terabytes or petabytes or exabytes or anything that is larger than this in size.
This does not defines the term Big Data completely.
Even a small amount of data can be referred to as Big Data depending on the context it is used.

Let me take an example and try to explain it to you.
For instance if we try to attach a document that is of 100 megabytes in size to an email we would not be able to do so.
As the email system would not support an attachment of this size.
Therefore this 100 megabytes of attachment with respect to email can be referred to as Big Data.

Let me take another example and try to explain the term Big Data.
Let us say we have around 10 terabytes of image files  upon which certain processing needs to be done.
For instance we may want to resize and enhance these images within a given time frame.
Suppose if we make use of the traditional system to perform this task.
We would not be able to accomplish this task within the given time frame.
As the computing resources of the traditional system would not be sufficient to accomplish this task on time.
Therefore this 10 terabytes of image files can be referred to as Big Data.

Now let us try to understand Big Data using some real world examples.
I believe you all might be aware of some the popular social networking sites  such as Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Google Plus and YouTube.
Each of this site  receives huge volume of data on a daily basis.
It has been reported on some of the popular tech blogs that.
Facebook alone receives around 100 terabytes of data each day.
Whereas Twitter processes around 400 million tweets each day.
As far as LinkedIn and Google Plus are concerned each of the site receives tens of terabytes of data on a daily basis.
And finally coming to YouTube  it has been reported that  each minute around 48 hours of fresh videos are uploaded to YouTube.
You can just imagine  how much volume of data is being stored and processed on these sites.
But as the number of users keep growing on these sites  storing and processing this data becomes a challenging task.
Since this data holds a lot of valuable information  this data needs to be processed in a short span of time.
By using this valuable information  companies can boost their sales and generate more revenue.
By making using of the traditional computing system  we would not be able to accomplish this task within the given time frame  as the computing resources of the traditional system would not be sufficient for processing and storing  such a huge volume of data.
This is where Hadoop comes into picture  we would be discussing Hadoop in more detail in the later sessions.
Therefore we can term this huge volume of data as Big Data.

Let me take another real world example related to the airline industry and try to explain the term Big Data.
For instance the aircrafts  while they are flying keep transmitting data to the air traffic control located at the airports.
The air traffic control uses this data to track and monitor the status and progress of the flight on a real time basis.
Since multiple aircrafts would be transmitting this data simultaneously to the air traffic control.
A huge volume of data gets accumulated at the air traffic control within a short span of time.
Therefore it becomes a challenging task to manage and process this huge volume of data using the traditional approach.
Hence we can term this huge volume of data as Big Data.

I hope you all might have understood  ""What is Big Data"".

This talk focuses on the real world experience on the architectural patterns and tools integrations used to solve real business problems with data. This will be a technical session that covers tools such as Hadoop and NoSQL data stores and how to use them for the right use cases. During the session we will dive into customer architectures and where they have had both successes and failures using a combination of tools to server both OLTP and OLAP workloads. Some of the successes will include large cost reduction in SQL licensing and SAN as well as reduction in overall data warehouse costs including ETL appliances and manpower. The other core focus will be on driving change into businesses and how these customers were able to become leaders or maintain leadership using the data at hand and a set of tools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH813u7_b0s,"Big Data bezeichnet unter anderem große Datenmengen  die wir täglich produzieren und die irgendwo gesammelt werden.
Doch was passiert mit diesen Daten eigentlich und warum werden Daten überhaupt gesammelt?

youknow ist einer der führenden Anbieter von Erklärvideos und E-Learning-Lösungen im deutschsprachigen Raum. Weitere Infos auf https://you-know.de  https://you-know.ch und https://you-know.at.

Du darfst dieses Erklärvideo gerne für eigene Zwecke verwenden. Voraussetzung ist  dass du uns namentlich nennst (youknow) und auf unsere Website verlinkst (https://you-know.de). 




Der Begriff „BigData“ bezeichnet Datenmengen  die so groß sind  dass man sie mit normaler Soft- oder Hardware bzw. herkömmlichen Methoden der Datenverarbeitung nicht mehr bewältigen kann. Wie entstehen solche Datenmengen? Ganz einfach: Wir alle speisen sie mit jedem Klick  jedem Online-Einkauf  jeder Eingabe ins Navigationsgerät  jeder Finanztransaktion  jedem Telefonat  jedem Fitnessstudiobesuch  jedem neuen Freund im sozialen Netzwerk... Das bedeutet: Die Datenberge wachsen – und zwar rasant.
Die gleiche Menge an Daten  die die Menschheit von ihrem Ursprung an bis zum Jahr 2002 geschaffen hat  entsteht im Jahr 2014 bereits in der Zeit  in der Sie einen Kaffee trinken – innerhalb von zehn Minuten. 
Mit dem Begriff „BigData“ sind aber häufig nicht nur die Daten an sich  sondern auch deren Analyse und Nutzung gemeint. Das bedeutet  dass man die Datenmenge nutzt  indem man darin automatisiert Muster und Zusammenhänge sucht. 
Ein Beispiel dafür kennt fast jeder vom Online Shopping: Empfehlungen à la „Kunden  die das kauften  kauften auch...“ basieren auf der Echtzeit-Auswertung von Millionen von Kaufdaten anderer Kunden. Mithilfe dieser Daten wird errechnet welche Produkte den Käufer mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit noch interessieren könnten. 
Ein ganz anderes Beispiel für die Analyse von BigData kommt aus den USA: Dort wurde über die automatisierte Auswertung von Tweets die Verbreitung einer Grippewelle vorhergesagt und eingedämmt.
Es sind unendlich viele Bereiche denkbar  in denen BigData zum Einsatz kommen kann: In der medizinischen Forschung können Massendaten helfen  die besten Therapien für Krankheiten wie Krebs zu finden. Maschinen können ihre eigenen Betriebsdaten nutzen  um daraus zu lernen und effizienter zu werden. Unternehmen können BigData nutzen  um ihre Kunden besser kennenzulernen und Produkte  Dienstleistungen und Werbung auf sie zuzuschneiden. Und das sind nur einige Beispiele...
Aber BigData wirft auch Fragen auf: Wem gehören die – häufig persönlichen – Daten? Ist es gefährlich  wenn nur wenige große Unternehmen sie kontrollieren? Wollen wir – und das ist ein reales Beispiel – wirklich von einem Online-Shop auf Basis des Kaufverhaltens erfahren  dass jemand schwanger ist? Und: Kommt irgendwann der Zeitpunkt  an dem auch menschliches Verhalten voraussagbar wird?
Also: BigData bietet enorme Chancen  aber auch Risiken. Es ist ein wenig wie bei der Entdeckung des Feuers durch die Steinzeit-Menschen: Man kann sich daran die Finger verbrennen oder eine Zivilisation darauf begründen.",26,180,535,4.8146167,youtube,"['explain-it', 'erklärvideo', 'erklärfilm', 'explain it', 'simpleshow', 'explainity', 'explanatory video', 'explanation video', 'erklär-video', 'explainer video', 'erklärung', 'explainr', 'erklären', 'big data', 'datenschutz', 'online shopping', 'daten', 'internet der dinge', 'software', 'datenverarbeitung', 'datenmengen', 'datenberg', 'datenanalyse', 'datennutzung', 'massendaten', 'datenflut', 'gefahr', 'einfach', 'data', 'erklärvideos', 'erklärfilme', 'erklärungsvideo', 'explainit', 'explain', 'youknow']",Big Data in 3 Minuten erklärt,114483,big data

An invisible powerful force is lifting professional basketball to new heights  transforming how this multibillion-dollar sport is played and  crucially how to win.

In elite sport the difference between success and failure is often the finest of margins. The Houston Rockets are one of the top teams in NBA basketball. They boast some of the sport's biggest stars  including the NBA's most valuable player in 2018.

In the past decade the Rockets have risen from mid-table mediocrity to serious NBA championship contenders. But it's not just big names that have fueled this dramatic ascent - it's big data.

The Rockets recent success owes much to their pioneering decision to start crunching data about every aspect of their game - and this is the man responsible. Computer scientist Daryl Morey is the sport's foremost data and statistics guru among NBA bosses. Ten years ago Daryl set out to find that winning formula. The Rockets were one of four NBA teams to install a pioneering video tracking system which mined raw data from games. What they discovered changed the way teams try to win. 

In the 1990s  long two-point shots from just inside the three-point line were common but Darryl's data analysis showed that statistically these shots provided the worst return.
 
In the 2017-18 season the Rockets made more three-pointers than any other team in NBA history and this was a major reason they won more games than any of their rivals. 

Professor Rajiv Masheswaran co-founded Second Spectrum. The analytics company gathers and codes a vast range of increasingly granular data for all 30 NBA teams. Cameras now track and record 3D spatial data for every player and ball movement at 25 frames per second. Machine learning technology uses this huge volume of data to produce interactive visualizations allowing teams to analyze the minutiae of their performances and achieve marginal gains on court.

There is a particular focus on all important data around player movement and the probability of making a shot.

Qualitative data analysis has even changed the type of players that successful teams like the Rockets have players today are on average leaner and more agile. When it comes to recruiting new players from the college draft each season  poring over data on player performance has given the Rockets a winning edge.

Basketball has constantly changed but it's about to enter a brave new world where data could be courtside in the hands of coaches  helping to swing a game as it happens.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HR3VJ2dPbE,"""Debugging big data analytics in Data-Intensive Scalable Computing (DISC) systems is a time-consuming effort. Today’s DISC systems offer very little tooling for debugging and  as a result  programmers spend countless hours analyzing log files and performing trial and error debugging. To aid this effort  UCLA developed BigDebug  an interactive debugging tool and automated fault localization service to help Apache Spark developers in debugging big data analytics. 
 
To emulate interactive step-wise debugging without reducing throughput  BigDebug provides simulated breakpoints that enable a user to inspect a program without actually pausing the entire distributed computation. It also supports on-demand watchpoints that enable a user to retrieve intermediate data using a guard predicate and transfer the selected data on demand. To understand the flow of individual records within a pipeline of RDD transformations  BigDebug provides data provenance capability  which can help understand how errors propagate through data processing steps. To support efficient trial-and-error debugging  BigDebug enables users to change program logic in response to an error at runtime through a realtime code fix feature  and selectively replay the execution from that step. Finally  BigDebug proposes an automated fault localization service that leverages all the above features together to isolate failure-inducing inputs  diagnose the root cause of an error  and resume the workflow for only affected data and code.

The BigDebug system should contribute to improving Spark developerproductivity and the correctness of their Big Data applications. This big data debugging effort is led by UCLA Professors Miryung Kim and Tyson Condie  and produced several research papers in top Software Engineering and Database conferences. The current version of BigDebug is publicly available at https://sites.google.com/site/sparkbigdebug/.

In this video expert instructor  Bill Appelbe will explain what  Hadoop is  actual examples of how it works and how it compares to traditional databases such as Oracle & SQL Server. And finally  what is included in the Hadoop ecosystem.,123,484,3257,4.8544378,youtube,"['Apache Hadoop (Software)', 'Software (Industry)', 'big data', 'hadoop training', 'Oracle Database (Software)', 'SQL (Programming Language)', 'MapReduce (Software)', 'big data training', 'Data (Dimension)']",What is Big Data and Hadoop?,988864,big data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoKlE67rTw,"The exponential growth and availability of data has come to play a pivotal role in the manner in which individuals  companies and society at large operate. Big data has become a buzzword  and while businesses scramble to utilize the constant flow of information  a succesful formula for monetizing big data is yet to be found. 

26-year-old serial entrepreneur Mathias Lundø Nielsen just might have discovered that magical formula. He is determined to show the world how we can utilize big data to bring unparalleled value to consumers and businesses alike  as he himself is doing at the moment with his latest venture in the luxury hotel industry.

Mathias Lundø Nielsen is a 26-year-old serial entrepreneur  who has already enjoyed enormous success with several businesses across various industries  from fashion to hotel booking. He is currently using big data to revolutionize the way we book our holidays.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoEx8ZvyXvU,"Health care is undergoing significant transformation  and digital health data is at the center of this change. According to the Centers for Disease Control  nearly 80 percent of the nation’s health care institutions have converted to an electronic medical record (EMR) system from the old paper-based system. New technologies like smartphone applications are also creating new stockpiles of digital data. Genetic data is growing as well; scientists can sequence a person’s entire DNA within 24 hours and for less than $1 000. Collectively  the amount of digital health data is expected to grow from 500 000 to 25 million terabytes over the next five years. 

Why do we care that our health information is now in a digital format? How does it benefit all of us?

People who work in health care—and every industry for that matter—are smart  well trained  and do their best to stay up-to-date with the latest research  methodologies and trends. However  it is not rational to assume individuals have the depth of knowledge or data access to deal with every situation they encounter. Furthermore  the health care field is already understaffed  and this issue will only get worse as the looming mass retirement of baby boomers from the health care workforce creates an unprecedented supply-and-demand crisis. 

Digitized health data has the potential to help mitigate this troubling situation. Predictive medicine uses computing power and statistical methods to analyze EMR and other health-related data to predict clinical outcomes for individual patients. Beyond health outcome forecasting  predictive medicine also can uncover surprising and often unanticipated clinical associations. 

Oklahoma State University’s Center for Health Systems Innovation (CHSI)  through its Institute for Predictive Medicine (IPM)  is a leader in the exploding field of predictive medicine thanks to the unprecedented donation by Cerner Corporation of its HIPAA-compliant clinical health database  one of the largest available in the United States. Specifically  this dataset represents clinical information from over 63 million patients and includes admission  discharge  clinical events  pharmacy  and laboratory data spanning more than 16 years. 

Over 20 full-time CHSI employees and nearly two dozen graduate students are working to execute the CHSI mission to transform rural and Native American health through data analytics. Further  CHSI has a number of ongoing partnerships with academia  health systems and corporations to extract value from digitized health data. 

One example of CHSI’s numerous predictive medicine projects is an effort to help physicians determine whether the performance of particular cardiovascular drugs varies by gender or race  or both. Conversely  this study will help indicate which drugs perform poorly or even cause complications in these populations. Other CHSI studies are designed to give physicians insight into whether patients with a particular disease are likely to develop or already have an associated disease  which will aid in co-managing these conditions and lead to better health care. Another project is designed to help hospitals use data on patient demographic characteristics  comorbidities  discharge setting  and other medical information contained in comprehensive EMR systems to determine if patients are at high risk for being readmitted for disease-associated complications. If patients are considered high risk  they can get the care and support necessary to prevent frequent cycling through the health care system. 

Predictive medicine can also lead to the creation and implementation of tools for managing larger patient loads  which can aid health care providers in dealing with supply-and-demand problems. For instance  CHSI has developed a clinical decision support system that can detect diabetic retinopathy with a high degree of accuracy using lab and comorbidity data available through primary care visits. This algorithm addresses the very real challenge of low patient compliance  particularly among rural and underserved populations  with annual ophthalmic eye exams  which are the gold standard for retinopathy detection and preventing vision impairment or total vision loss. CHSI is extending this work to other common diabetes-related microvascular complications with the goal of developing a comprehensive suite of tools that can help increase prevention and management of these complications among the nation’s growing diabetic population.",1,828,42,4.909091,youtube,"['medicine X', 'MedX', 'epatient', 'patient-centered', 'health care', 'medicine', 'Stanford', 'school of medicine', 'academia', 'medical education', 'wellness', 'Digital health', 'medical records', 'genomics']",William Paiva: Transforming health care and medical education through clinical Big Data analytics,4532,big data

OpenCV is an image processing library created by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and now maintained by Itseez. opencv is available on Mac  Windows  Linux. Works in C  C++  and Python.
it is Open Source and free. opencv is easy to use and install.

Starting with an overview of what the course will be covering  we move on to discussing morphological operations and practically learn how they work on images. We will then learn contrast enhancement using equalization and contrast limiting.  Finally we will learn 3 methods to subtract the background from the video and implement them using OpenCV.

At the end of this course  you will have a firm grasp of Computer Vision techniques using OpenCV libraries. This course will be your gateway to the world of data science.  

Feel the real power of Python and programming! The course offers you a unique approach of learning how to code by solving real world problems.

Should you start off with Java  C++  C  Python  Javascript  SQL  Swift  Objective-C or what!??

... Feeling overwhelmed yet before you even began your journey as a software developer? If so  good! The point of this video is to discuss all of that in a simple way and clarify common misconceptions among beginning coders when they are about to start. We discuss different programming languages and suggest which language you should perhaps start off with first. You can always switch over later! The important thing is to understand the concepts in a computer programming language especially as a beginner. Do not try to deal with both conceptual difficulty and syntactical difficulty at the same time. Imagine if you never knew any human language and you tried to start off by learning Japanese as an adult  that would be really tough. Start simple  learn the concepts  then transition to another language. We will talk about which languages to avoid as a beginner!

I worked on this project with my friend. Never knew ANY Javascript but picked it up within one day and built this whole thing together with my friend in about 1-2 days.

The idea behind the app is to be able to download commonly visited locations on an excel sheet and print them so when your GPS dies on you... You are still good to go.

I did a lot of private chess lessons and I depended on my GPS for the job. However  sometimes it died on me in very critical situations and that almost got me fired from my job.
This app was made for people who can use this in order to not have to rely on GPS solely to get to their destination.

I start the demo by writing a callback-based async framework  built on non-blocking sockets and a simple event loop. Then I adapt the framework to use generator-based coroutines  which are cleaner than callbacks but still more efficient than threads for async I/O.

Python doesn't have switch/case statements so it's often necessary to write long if/elif/else chains as a workaround. Here's a little trick you can use to emulate switch/case statements in Python using dictionaries and first-class functions.

Basically we're using Python dictionaries as a lookup table to replace a nested ""if elif else"" statement with a cleaner and more maintainable implementation.

In some cases this can be faster than if-then-else chains and easier to maintain  too. To see if this method is right for you watch the video tutorial and learn how to apply this technique to write nice and clean Python.

ABSTRACT

The Python language  while object-oriented  is fundamentally different from both C++ and Java. The dynamic and introspective nature of Python allow for language mechanics unlike that of static languages. This talk aims to enlighten programmers new to Python about these fundamentals  the language mechanics that flow from them and how to effectively put those to use. Among the topics covered are duck-typing  interfaces  descriptors  decorators  metaclasses  reference-counting and the cyclic-garbage collector  the divide between C/C++ data and Python objects and the CPython implementation in general.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSe9Tu_iNQQ&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfju7ADVp5W1GF9jVhjbX-_,"Welcome to the intermediate Python programming tutorial series. In this series  we're going to be taking the ""next steps"" after one has become comfortable with the basics of Python  and has been working with it for a bit.

Up to this point  my tutorials have all been done using very basic  rudimentary Python. My definition of basic Python: code that is meant to ""just make it run."" This is fine for beginners  because there's not much point in overloading with nuances (most people wont retain it  since they don't care  at least I didn't when I was starting out).

I define intermediate Python code as:

Modular - Easily used by others and/or in other projects by you or others. Basically  write code with the intention to honor DRY (don't repeat yourself).
Maintainable - ...Both by the original author and by other users. Is it easily read-able and understood?
Scales - For this to happen  code needs to be efficient when it runs  and be able to scale. Think about reading files  working with requests  or doing calculations. Maintainability also plays a major role in scaling.
In general  code that meets the above standards in Python is done with the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. There does exist another paradigm  called Functional Programming (FP)  and there are bloody wars fought over which is better. We're going to use OOP. Either one of these is better than outright scripting  which what most beginner programmers are really doing.

To begin this series  I am going to teach a few basic standard library functions and functionalities of Python that will replace otherwise bad habits in programming  before getting into Object Oriented Programming and design.

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
This is a pretty abstract idea  that multiple languages are based off (Java  Python  Ruby  C++  and more). It turns out that many beginner courses don’t actually take advantage building objects in object-oriented languages. Instead  they first teach you variables  loops  if-statements  etc… so it make sense. Now is the best time to practice 🙂

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUKOEuPJXGc,"Welcome to part 11 of the intermediate Python programming tutorial series. In this part  we're going to talk more about the built-in library: multiprocessing.

In the previous multiprocessing tutorial  we showed how you can spawn processes. If these processes are fine to act on their own  without communicating with eachother or back to the main program  then this is fine. These processes can also share a common database  or something like that to work together  but  many times  it will make more sense to use multiprocessing to do some processing  and then return results back to the main program. That's what we're going to cover here.

A somewhat common task might be to attempt to attach an index value  or some other unique value to list items. It may be temping to use something a for loop over range(len(your_variable))  but this is usually not quite the right way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSe9Tu_iNQQ,"Welcome to the intermediate Python programming tutorial series. In this series  we're going to be taking the ""next steps"" after one has become comfortable with the basics of Python  and has been working with it for a bit.

Up to this point  my tutorials have all been done using very basic  rudimentary Python. My definition of basic Python: code that is meant to ""just make it run."" This is fine for beginners  because there's not much point in overloading with nuances (most people wont retain it  since they don't care  at least I didn't when I was starting out).

I define intermediate Python code as:

Modular - Easily used by others and/or in other projects by you or others. Basically  write code with the intention to honor DRY (don't repeat yourself).
Maintainable - ...Both by the original author and by other users. Is it easily read-able and understood?
Scales - For this to happen  code needs to be efficient when it runs  and be able to scale. Think about reading files  working with requests  or doing calculations. Maintainability also plays a major role in scaling.
In general  code that meets the above standards in Python is done with the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. There does exist another paradigm  called Functional Programming (FP)  and there are bloody wars fought over which is better. We're going to use OOP. Either one of these is better than outright scripting  which what most beginner programmers are really doing.

To begin this series  I am going to teach a few basic standard library functions and functionalities of Python that will replace otherwise bad habits in programming  before getting into Object Oriented Programming and design.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEYDqQ1pq9o,"Welcome to part 10 of the intermediate Python programming tutorial series. In this part  we're going to talk about the built-in library: multiprocessing.

Let us take a moment to talk about the GIL. The GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. What the GIL does for us is... hmm... well it serves as a sort of memory management safeguard. Sounds like a good idea I guess  but not really. The real problem is that  since the GIL has existed  people have built infrastructure around it. There are better options today  but ripping out the GIL would be catastrophic.

Alright  so the GIL is here to stay for probably a while. What's that mean? Python is single threaded. Even if you use threading  Python runs on a single CPU. If you have 4 physical cores  your computer probably thinks you have 8  and you're using 1 of those 8  including when threading. All threading really lets you do is access idle threads  and nothing more. It's not using more power  its just using idle power. If you monitor your CPU %  you might see that you're only using 10 or 15%  instead of the desired 100%  or at least close to it.

Well that stinks! What can we do?! Enter multiprocessing!

If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples  this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL  short for Structured Query Language  is a language used by software developers  data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL  you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course  we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server)  you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.

These videos have an intrinsic cost of about $1000 to make so if you enjoy them  please consider donating so that I can make more videos on a more regular basis! It's not just standing up and talking. It could be weeks of planning/research  then multiple takes  then hours of editing then responding to comments. Don't forget the thousands spent on the equipment used. I've spent a lot of money on the equipment I use to shoot/edit these and when they fail (which they are)  I have to spend even more money to replace then. Then there is the fact I use up all my free time to do videos now. I have put aside friends and family to focus on this because I feel this is my calling to help others. My job is also very demanding and always comes first  so that leaves little time for videos. Thanks!

NOTE:
SQL combines the roles of data definition  data manipulation  and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model  although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example  the rows and columns of a table can be ordered).

This is a very common SQL Server Interview Question. There are several ways of finding the nth highest salary. 

By the end of this video  we will be able to answer all the following questions as well.
How to find nth highest salary in SQL Server using a Sub-Query
How to find nth highest salary in SQL Server using a CTE
How to find the 2nd  3rd or 15th highest salary

Let's use the following Employees table for this demo

Use the following script to create Employees table
Create table Employees
(
 ID int primary key identity 
 FirstName nvarchar(50) 
 LastName nvarchar(50) 
 Gender nvarchar(50) 
 Salary int
)
GO

Insert into Employees values ('Ben'  'Hoskins'  'Male'  70000)
Insert into Employees values ('Mark'  'Hastings'  'Male'  60000)
Insert into Employees values ('Steve'  'Pound'  'Male'  45000)
Insert into Employees values ('Ben'  'Hoskins'  'Male'  70000)
Insert into Employees values ('Philip'  'Hastings'  'Male'  45000)
Insert into Employees values ('Mary'  'Lambeth'  'Female'  30000)
Insert into Employees values ('Valarie'  'Vikings'  'Female'  35000)
Insert into Employees values ('John'  'Stanmore'  'Male'  80000)
GO

To find the highest salary it is straight forward. We can simply use the Max() function as shown below.
Select Max(Salary) from Employees

To get the second highest salary use a sub query along with Max() function as shown below.
Select Max(Salary) from Employees where Salary [ (Select Max(Salary) from Employees)

To find nth highest salary using Sub-Query
SELECT TOP 1 SALARY
FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT TOP N SALARY
      FROM EMPLOYEES
      ORDER BY SALARY DESC
      ) RESULT
ORDER BY SALARY

To find nth highest salary using CTE
WITH RESULT AS
(
    SELECT SALARY 
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS DENSERANK
    FROM EMPLOYEES
)
SELECT TOP 1 SALARY
FROM RESULT
WHERE DENSERANK = N

To find 2nd highest salary we can use any of the above queries. Simple replace N with 2. 

Similarly  to find 3rd highest salary  simple replace N with 3. 

Please Note: On many of the websites  you may have seen that  the following query can be used to get the nth highest salary. The below query will only work if there are no duplicates.
WITH RESULT AS
(
    SELECT SALARY 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS ROWNUMBER
    FROM EMPLOYEES
)
SELECT SALARY
FROM RESULT
WHERE ROWNUMBER = 3",193,705,5827,4.8717608,youtube,"['sql query to find second highest salary of employee', 'nth highest salary in sql', 'sql server interview questions and answers', 'for freshers', 'for experienced', '3 years experience']",Part 1   How to find nth highest salary in sql,1175083,SQL language

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgipNdAgQ3o,SQL is the winning language of Big Data. Whether you’re running a classic relational database  a column store (“NewSQL”)  or a non-relational storage system (“NoSQL”)  a powerful  declarative  SQL-based query language makes the difference. The SQL standard has evolved drastically in the past decades  and so have its commercial and open source implementations. In this fast-paced talk  we’re going to look at very peculiar and interesting data problems and how we can solve them with SQL. We’ll explore common table expressions  hierarchical SQL  table-valued functions  lateral joins  row value expressions  window functions  and advanced data types  such as XML and JSON. And we’ll look at Oracle’s mysterious MODEL and MATCH_RECOGNIZE clauses  devices whose mystery is only exceeded by their power. Most importantly  however  we’re going to learn that everyone can write advanced SQL. Once you learn the basics in these tricks  you’re going to love SQL even more.,8,2710,245,4.873518,youtube,['DevoxxFR16'],Ten SQL Tricks that You Didn’t Think Were Possible (Lukas Eder),24385,SQL language

It's also called the language for statistical computing  and is one of the most popular languages to do data science  used by tons of companies and universities around the globe in all sorts of fields. Optimizing a financial portfolio? Mapping marketing data? Analyzing outcomes of clinical trials? You name it  R can handle it.

But why did R become so popular? Well  first of all  it's free to use! Next  R's visualization capabilities are top notch  making it easy to build beautiful plots. It's also easy to create so-called packages  which are extensions to R. R's very active community has created thousands of these packages for many different fields. Last but not least  R is an actual programming language  with a command-line interface for executing code. This is a big plus compared to other point-and-click programs out there. It might take some energy to fully get the hang of it  but feat not: DataCamp is here to help you master R in no time! Let's get started.

An important component of R  is the console. It's a place where you can execute R commands. In DataCamp's interactive interface  the console can be found here. Let's try to calculate the sum of 1 and 2. We simply type 1 + 2 at the prompt the console and hit Enter. R interprets what you typed and prints the result.

R is more than a scientific calculator  though. You can also create so-called variables. A variable allows you to store data in R for later use. You can use the less than sign followed by a dash to create a variable. Suppose the height of a rectangle is 2. Let's assign this value 2 to a variable height. In the console  we type height  less than sign  dash  2:

This time  R does not print anything  because it assumes that you will be using this variable in the future. If you now simply type and execute height in the console  R returns 2:

We can do a similar thing for the width of our imaginary rectangle. We assign the value 4 to a variable width.

Typing width gives us 4  great.

As you're assigning variables in the R console  you're actually accumulating the R workspace. It's the place where R variables 'live'. You can list all variables with the ls() function. Simply type ls followed by empty parentheses and hit enter.

This shows you a list of all the variables you have created up to now. There are two objects in your workspace at the moment  height and width. I we try to access variable that's not in the workspace  depth for example  R throws an error.

Suppose you now want to find out the area of our imaginary rectangle  which is height multiplied by width. height equals 2  and width equals 4  so the result is 8. Let's also assign this result to a new variable  area.

Inspecting the workspace again with ls  shows that the workspace contains three objects now: area  height and width.

Now  this is all great  but what if you want to recalculate the area of your imaginary rectangle when the height is 3 and the width is 6? You'd have to reassign the variables width and height in the console  and then recalculate the area. That's quite some coding you'd have to redo  isn't it?

This is the place where R scripts come in! An R script is simply a text file with succesive lines of R code. Let's create such a script  ""rectangle.R""  that contains the code that we've written up to now.

Next  you can run this script. In the DataCamp interface  you can do this with the 'Submit Answer' button. R goes through your code  line by line  executing every command one by one in the console  just as if you are typing each command yourself. The cool thing is  that if you want to change your code  you can simply adapt your script and run it again. Let's change the height to 3 and the width to 6  and rerun the script. The variables are given different values this time  and the output changes accordingly.",47,291,1264,4.8565979,youtube,"['R (Programming Language)', 'data science']",R tutorial - The True Basics of R,243347,R language

From Excel To Big Data and Interactive Dashboard Visualizations in 5 Hours

If you use Excel for any type of reporting or analytics then this course is for you. There are a lot of great courses teaching R for statistical analysis and data science that can sometimes make R seem a bit too advanced for every day use. Also since there are many different ways of using R that can often add to the confusion. The reality is that R can be used to make your every day reporting analytics that you do in Excel much faster and easier without requiring any complex statistical techniques while at the same time giving you a solid foundation to expand into those areas if you so wish. This course uses the Tidyverse standards for using R which provides a single  comprehensive and easy to understand method for using R without complicating things via multiple methods. It's designed to build upon the the skills you are already familiar with in Excel to shortcut your learning journey. If you're looking to learn Advanced Excel  Excel VBA or Databases then you need to check out this video series. In this videos series  I will show you how to use Microsoft Excel in different ways that will make you far more effective at working with data. I'm also going to expand your knowledge beyond Excel and show you tips  tricks  and tools from other top data analytics tools such as R Tidyverse  Python  Data Visualisation tools such as Tableau  Qlik View  Qlik Sense  Plotly  AWS Quick Sight and others. We'll start to touch on areas such as big data  machine learning  and cloud computing and see how you can develop your data skills to get involved in these exciting areas.

Excel Formulas such as vlookup and sumifs are some of the top reasons for slow spreadsheets. Alternatives for vlookup include power query (Excel 2010 and Excel 2013) which has recently been renamed to Get and Transform in Excel 2016. Large and complex vlookup formulas can be also done very efficiently in R. Using the R Tidyverse libraries you can use the join functions to merge millions of records effortlessly. In comparison to Excel Vlookup  R Tidyverse Join can pull on multiple columns all at the same time. Microsoft Excel Power Query and R Tidyverse Joins are similar to the joins that you do in databases / SQL. The benefit that they have over relational databases such as Microsoft Access  Microsoft SQL Server  MySQL  etc is that they work in memory so they are actually much faster than a database. Also since they are part of an analytics tool instead of a database it is much faster and easier to build your analysis and queries all in the same tools. 

My very first R Tidyverse program was written to replace a Microsoft Access VBA solution which was becoming complicated and slow. Note that Microsoft Access is very limited in analytics functions and is missing things as simple as Median. Even though I had to learn R programming from scratch and completely re-write the Microsoft Access VBA solution it was so much easier and faster. It blew my mind how much easier R programming with R Tidyverse was than Microsoft Access VBA or Microsoft Excel VBA. If you have any VBA skills or are looking to learn VBA you should definitely checkout my videos on R Tidyverse. To understand why R Tidyverse is so much easier to work with than VBA. R Tidyverse is designed to work directly with your data. So If you want to add a calculated column that’s around one line of script. In Excel VBA  the VBA is used to control the DOM (Document Object Model). In Excel that means that you VBA controls things like cells and sheets. This means your VBA is designed to capture the steps that you would normally do manually in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Access. VBA is not actually designed to work directly with your data. 

Note the most efficient path is to reduce the data pulled down from the database in the first place. This is referring to the amount of data you are pulling down from your data warehouse or data lake. It makes no sense to pull data from a data warehouse / data lake to pull into another database to query add joins / lookups to then pull it into Excel or other analysis tool. Often analyst build these intermediate databases because they either don’t have control of the data warehouse or they need to join additional information. All of these operations are done significantly faster in a tool such as R Tidyverse or Microsoft Excel Power Query.",12,402,359,4.8706198,youtube,"['r for excel users', 'Tidyverse', 'R Tidyverse', 'tidveryse r', 'Free Tidyverse Course', 'r tidyverse reporting and analytics for excel users', 'why use r?', 'free r tutorial', 'tidyverse tutorial', 'r tutorial for data analysis', 'r for data analytics', 'r vs excel', 'r vs excel for data analysis', 'excel vs r', 'r for data visualization', 'tidyverse r tutorial', 'learn R tidyverse', 'intro to R for excel', 'r programming', 'r programming for data analysis', 'r programming for beginners', 'free r course']",Why Use R? - R Tidyverse Reporting and Analytics for Excel Users,27813,R language

Adding R programming to your data analyst skillset allows you to leverage powerful data visualizations  statistical analyses  and even machine learning in your daily work. 

In this presentation  we illustrate how your knowledge of performing data analyses in Microsoft Excel gives you a unique foundation for quickly learning how to apply R in your daily work. 

No knowledge of R coding is required for this meetup as we will illustrate scenarios in Excel and then walk through how each Excel scenario is implemented in R.

Attendees will learn how:

• Fundamental concepts of Excel (e.g.  working with tables  collections of cells  and functions) translate 100% to working with data in R.

• Excel pivot tables translate to R code.

• Creating charts in Excel is very similar to creating data visualizations in R.

• R offers visualizations not available in Excel out of the box.

An Excel spreadsheet and R code will be made available in our repository

Have a look at the recipe for the if statement: The `if` statement takes a condition; if the condition evaluates to `TRUE`  the R code associated with the if statement is executed. The condition to check appears inside parentheses  while the R code that has to be executed if the condition is `TRUE`  follows in curly brackets.
Let's have a look at an example. Suppose we have a variable `x` equal to -3. If this `x` is smaller than zero  we want R to print out ""x is a negative number!"". How can we do this using the `if` statement? We first assign the variable  `x` and then write the `if` test. 
If we run this bit of code  we indeed see that the string ""x is a negative number"" gets printed out. However  if we change `x` to 5  and re-run the code  the condition will be FALSE  the code is not executed  and the printout will not occur.

This brings us to the `else` statement: this conditional statement does not need an explicit condition; instead  it has to be used together with an if statement. The code associated with an else statement gets executed whenever the condition of the `if` test is not satisfied. We can extend our recipe by including an else statement as follows:
Returning to our example  suppose we want to print out ""x is positive or zero""  whenever the condition is not met. We can simply add the else statement:
The else if statement comes in between the if and else statement. To see how R deals with these different conditions and corresponding code blocks  let's first extend our example. We want R to print out ""x is zero"" if `x` equals 0 and to print out ""x is a positive number"" otherwise. We add the else if  together with a new print statement  and adapt the message we print on the else statement:
How does R process this control structure? Let's first go through what happens when x equals -3. In this case  the condition for the `if` statement evaluates to `TRUE`  so ""x is a negative number"" gets printed out  and R ignores the rest of the statements. If x equals 0  R will first check the if condition  sees that it is FALSE  and will then head over to the else if condition. This condition  `x == 0`  evaluates to `TRUE`  so ""x is zero"" gets printed to the console  and R ignores the else statement entirely. Finally  what happens when x equals 5? Well  the `if` condition evaluates to `FALSE`  so does the `else if` condition  so R executes the else statement  printing ""x is a positive number"".
Remember that as soon as R stumbles upon a condition that evaluates to `TRUE`  R executes the corresponding code and then ignores the rest of the control structure. This becomes important if the conditions you list are not mutually exclusive.",2,266,170,4.9534883,youtube,"['R (Programming Language)', 'statistics']",R Tutorial - How To Use Conditional Statements in R,45784,R language

These concepts are first presented conceptually  with computational practice afterward.

Want to take the interactive coding exercises and earn a certificate? Join DataCamp today  and start our intermediate R tutorial for free: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r

The and operator works just as you would expect. It typically takes two logical values and returns `TRUE` only if both the logical values are `TRUE` themselves. This means that `TRUE and TRUE` evaluates `TRUE`  but that `FALSE and TRUE`  `TRUE and FALSE` and `FALSE and FALSE` all evaluate to `FALSE`. 

Instead of using logical values  we can off course use the results of comparisons. Suppose we have a variable `x`  equal to 12. To check if this variable is greater than 5 but less than 15  we can use x greater than 5 and x less than 15. As you already learned  the first part will evaluate to `TRUE`. The second part  will also evaluate to `TRUE`. So the result of this expression is `TRUE`. This makes sense  because 12 lies between 5 and 15. 

However  if `x` were equal to 17  the expression `x greater than 5 & x less than 15` would simplify to `TRUE and FALSE`. which results in this expression being `FALSE`.

The OR operator (`|`) works similarly  but the difference is that only at least one of the logical values it uses should be equal to `TRUE` for the OR operation to evaluate to TRUE. This means that  `TRUE or TRUE` equals `TRUE`  but that also `TRUE | FALSE` and `FALSE | TRUE` evaluate to `TRUE`. When both logicals are `FALSE` in an OR operation  so in the case of FALSE or FALSE  the result is `FALSE`. Remember that the OR operation is not an exclusive or operation  `TRUE or TRUE` equals `TRUE` as well. 

Just as for AND operators  we can use comparisons together with the OR operator. Suppose we have a variable `y`  equal to 5 this time. To see if this variable is less than 5 or greater than 15  we can use this expression. R will first carry out the comparisons  resulting in TRUE or FALSE  which in turn results in `TRUE`. Now  let's have `y` equal 14. The expression y less than 5 or y greater than 15 now evaluates to FALSE | FALSE. Neither one of the comparisons are `TRUE`  so the result is `FALSE`.

There's one last operator I want to talk about here  the NOT operator. The NOT operator  represented by an exclamation mark  simply negates the logical value it's used on. So exlamation mark TRUE evaluates to FALSE  while exlamation mark FALSE. evaluates to TRUE. Just as the OR and AND operators  you can use the NOT operator in combination with logical operators. This is not always necessary  however  because this line of code  is exactly the same as this one. However  there are cases in R where the NOT operator is really handy. For example  the built-in R function  `is.numeric()` checks if an R object is a numeric. As an illustration  take  is.numeric(5)  which evaluates to `TRUE`  as 5 is a numeric. If we negate this result using the NOT operator  
!is.numeric(5) we get false. If  however  we type is.numeric(""hello"") we get `FALSE`. Negating this results in `TRUE`.

Now  how do logical operators work with vectors and matrices? Well  just as relational operators  they perform the operations element-wise. The and operation on these two vectors  results in a vector with the elements TRUE  FALSE and FALSE.

The first elements in both vectors are `TRUE`  so the first element of the resulting vector contains TRUE. Similarly  for the second elements where `TRUE` and `FALSE` result in `FALSE`  and the third elements  where `FALSE` and `FALSE` give `FALSE`. 

A similar thing happens with the OR operator:
`TRUE | TRUE` gives `TRUE`  `TRUE | FALSE` also gives `TRUE`  and `FALSE | FALSE` gives `FALSE`. The NOT operator also works on every element of the vector: `TRUE`s are converted to `FALSE`s  and `FALSE`s are converted to `TRUE`s.

Now  there's one last thing I want to warn you about. It's about the difference between a single and a double ampersand or vertical bar. In R you can use both the single sign version or the double sign version  but the result of the logical operation you're carrying out can be different. The biggest difference occurs when you use the two types of operators on vectors. As we've seen before  this expression  evaluates to a vector containing TRUE  FALSE and FALSE.

However  if we use a double ampersand  we simply get `TRUE`. That's because the double ampersand operation only examines the first element of each vector. In this case the first elements are `TRUE` and `TRUE`  so the expression returns `TRUE`. You can see similar things happening with the OR operator. The single sign version returns an entire vector. The double sign version returns only the result of the OR operator on the first element of each vector.

Another difference between a single and a doule ampersand that is less obvious  has something to do with control structures  but that's more advanced material.",2,336,108,4.9272728,youtube,"['R (Programming Language)', 'Statistics (Field Of Study)']",R Tutorial - Logical Operators and Vectors in R,21072,R language

This statistics video tutorial presents the boxplots and all of the useful info they convey. A boxplot is a commonly seen plot  and conveys a lot of information in a single plot. You have likely seen these plots in many papers. They are useful for describing the distribution of a numeric variable  as well as indicating a few key points  such as the median and quartiles.  They are also useful in identifying outliers.  While an outlier should not just be removed from a dataset without just cause  it can be helpful in identifying these observations for further examination  or at least for understanding where they are.  Later  we will discuss the effect outliers can have on summary measures such as the mean and standard deviation.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there  and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks  spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers  or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there  and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks  spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers  or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qVOUD76JOg,"Did you know that art and technology can produce fascinating results when combined? Mike Tyka  who is both artist and computer scientist  talks about the power of neural networks. These algorithms are capable to transform computers into artists that can generate breathtaking paintings  music and even poetry.

Dr. Mike Tyka studied Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of Bristol. He obtained his Ph.D. in Biophysics in 2007 and went on to work as a research fellow at the University of Washington  studying the structure and dynamics of protein molecules. In particular  he has been interested in protein folding and has been writing computer simulation software to better understand this fascinating process.

In 2009  Mike and a team of artists created Groovik’s Cube  a 35 feet tall  functional  multi-player Rubik’s cube. Since then  he co-founded ATLSpace  an artist studio in Seattle and has been creating metal and glass sculptures of protein molecules. In 2013 Mike went to Google to study neural networks  both artificial and natural. This work naturally spilled over to his artistic interests  exploring the possibilities of artificial neural networks for creating art.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there  and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks  spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers  or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there  and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks  spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers  or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data  these computer programs are enabled to learn  grow  change  and develop by themselves. So  put simply  the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live  and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now  let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia  ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms  Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However  it is becoming very difficult for companies to store  retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well  nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago  with increasing amount and complexity of data  these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing  handling  evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes  and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer  to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect  and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life  then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Hadoop and its associated distributions from Hortonworks  Cloudera and MapR include a dizzying array of technologies. We will start talking about the origins and history of Hadoop  and then take a look at how all the different open-source systems that surround Hadoop clusters fit together. After this video  you will have a high level overview of the biggest systems in the world of Hadoop today and see how they interoperate. 

Apache projects tend to have cryptic names  and we will decipher what they all really do. We will talk briefly about the core components of Hadoop: HDFS  YARN  and MapReduce. And then we will touch upon all the other systems  built up around them  including Apache Spark  Hive  Pig  Ambari  Oozie  Zookeeper  Sqoop  Flume  Kafka  Mesos  HBase  Storm  Hue  Presto  Zeppelin  MySQL  Cassandra  MongoDB  Drill  and Phoenix. 

My larger course covers each technology in more depth  but at the end of this video  these terms should at least make sense to you and you will be less confused when people talk about them all. 

Course Description
The world of Hadoop and ""Big Data"" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course  you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!

Learn and master the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course  taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We'll go way beyond Hadoop itself  and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.

Install and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks and the Ambari UI
Manage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce
Write programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark
Store and query your data with Sqoop  Hive  MySQL  HBase  Cassandra  MongoDB  Drill  Phoenix  and Presto
Design real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem
Learn how your cluster is managed with YARN  Mesos  Zookeeper  Oozie  Zeppelin  and Hue
Handle streaming data in real time with Kafka  Flume  Spark Streaming  Flink  and Storm
Understanding Hadoop is a highly valuable skill for anyone working at companies with large amounts of data.

Almost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way  including Amazon  Ebay  Facebook  Google  LinkedIn  IBM   Spotify  Twitter  and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New York Times uses Hadoop for processing images.

This course is comprehensive  covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises  so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.

You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords  there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines  we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer  I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala  Pig Latin  and Python.

You'll walk away from this course with a real  deep understanding of Hadoop and its associated distributed systems  and you can apply Hadoop to real-world problems. Plus a valuable completion certificate is waiting for you at the end! 

Please note the focus on this course is on application development  not Hadoop administration. Although you will pick up some administration skills along the way.

I hope to see you in the course soon!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia  ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms  Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However  it is becoming very difficult for companies to store  retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well  nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago  with increasing amount and complexity of data  these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing  handling  evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes  and even petabytes of data.

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer  to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect  and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life  then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

In this talk  Dr. Shailesh Kumar focuses on the ""ART of data mining"" - the little things that make the big difference in the quality and sophistication of machine learning models we build. Using real-world analytics problems from a variety of domains  Shailesh shares a number of practical learnings in:

(1) The art of understanding the data better - (e.g. visualization of text data in a semantic space)

(2) The art of feature engineering - (e.g. converting raw inputs into meaningful and discriminative features)

(3) The art of dealing with nuances in class labels - (e.g. creating  sampling  and cleaning up class labels)

(4) The art of combining labeled and unlabelled data - (e.g. semi-supervised and active learning)

(5) The art of decomposing a complex modelling problem into simpler ones - (e.g. divide and conquer)

(6) The art of using textual features with structured features to build models  etc.

The key objective of the talk is to share some of the learnings that might come in handy while ""designing"" and ""debugging"" machine learning solutions and to give a fresh perspective on why data mining is still mostly an ART.",0,4706,17,5,youtube,"['hasgeek', 'Algorithm (Literature Subject)', 'Data Mining (Software Genre)', 'Technology', 'The Fifth Elephant', 'Data mining', 'Machine Learning', 'Data visualization', 'visualization', 'data science']",The ART of Data Mining – Practical learnings from real-world data mining applications,2228,data mining

Deep Learning with TensorFlow Introduction

The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured. Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structure in  for instance  images  sound  and textual data. Deep networks are capable of discovering hidden structures within this type of data. In this TensorFlow course you'll use Google's library to apply deep learning to different data types in order to solve real world problems.

Traditional neural networks rely on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layer  or so-called more depth. These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which is the vast majority of data in the world.

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

In this TensorFlow course  you will be able to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow  the main functions  operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example  throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting  regression  classification and minimization of error functions.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions  using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations  while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact  it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there  and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks  spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets  composed of one input  one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers  or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images  sound  and text)  which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in your application. It provides generalized and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management  including persistence.

Core Data typically decreases by 50 to 70 percent the amount of code you write to support the model layer. This is primarily due to the following built-in features that you do not have to implement  test  or optimize:

Change tracking and built-in management of undo and redo beyond basic text editing.

Maintenance of change propagation  including maintaining the consistency of relationships among objects.

Lazy loading of objects  partially materialized futures (faulting)  and copy-on-write data sharing to reduce overhead.

Automatic validation of property values. Managed objects extend the standard key-value coding validation methods to ensure that individual values lie within acceptable ranges  so that combinations of values make sense.

Schema migration tools that simplify schema changes and allow you to perform efficient in-place schema migration.

Optional integration with the application’s controller layer to support user interface synchronization.

Grouping  filtering  and organizing data in memory and in the user interface.

Automatic support for storing objects in external data repositories.
Sophisticated query compilation. Instead of writing SQL  you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request.

Version tracking and optimistic locking to support automatic multiwriter conflict resolution.

Effective integration with the macOS and iOS tool chains.

Creating a Managed Object Model

Much of Core Data’s functionality depends on the schema you create to describe your application’s entities  their properties  and the relationships between them. Core Data uses a schema called a managed object model — an instance of NSManagedObjectModel. In general  the richer the model  the better Core Data is able to support your application.

A managed object model allows Core Data to map from records in a persistent store to managed objects that you use in your application. The model is a collection of entity description objects (instances of NSEntityDescription). An entity description describes an entity (which you can think of as a table in a database) in terms of its name  the name of the class used to represent the entity in your application  and what properties (attributes and relationships) it has.

Creating an Entity and Its Properties

When you start a new project in Xcode and open the template selection dialog  select the Use Core Data checkbox. A source file for the Core Data model is created as part of the template. That source file will have the extension .xcdatamodeld. Select that file in the navigator area to display the Core Data model editor.

Entity Name and Class Name

Note that the entity name and the class name (a subclass of NSManagedObject) are not the same. The entity structure in the data model does not need to match the class hierarchy. Figure 2-2 shows a class name with the recommended class name pattern of Objective-C  along with an MO suffix. An entity name and a class name are required.

Managed Object Context

A managed object context represents a single object space  or scratch pad  in a Core Data application. A managed object context is an instance of NSManagedObjectContext. Its primary responsibility is to manage a collection of managed objects. These managed objects represent an internally consistent view of one or more persistent stores. The context is a powerful object with a central role in the life-cycle of managed objects  with responsibilities from life-cycle management (including faulting) to validation  inverse relationship handling  and undo/redo.

From your perspective  the context is the central object in the Core Data stack. It’s the object you use to create and fetch managed objects  and to manage undo and redo operations. Within a given context  there is at most one managed object to represent any given record in a persistent store.",0,714,49,5,youtube,"['nsmanagedobjectcontext', 'managed object context', 'context', 'context core data', 'core data managed object content', 'managed object context tutorial', 'core data context', 'core data context tutorial', 'video tutorial context', 'core data parts', 'core data components', 'core data video tutorial', 'intermediate core data', 'core data video', 'core data videos']",Managed Object Contexts - Intermediate Core Data - raywenderlich.com,5157,data management

Apache Spark is arguably the hottest technology in the field of big data right now. It allows you to process and extract meaning from massive data sets on a cluster  whether it is a Hadoop cluster you administer or a cloud-based deployment. 

In this series of 8 videos  we will walk through installing Spark on a Hortonworks sandbox running right on your own PC  and we will talk about how Spark works and its architecture. 

We will then dive hands-on into the origins of Spark by working directly with RDDs Resilient Distributed Datasets and then move on to the modern Spark 2.0 way of programming with Datasets. 

You will get hands-on practice writing a few simple Spark applications using the Python programming language  and then we will actually build a movie recommendation engine using real movie ratings data  and Sparks machine learning library MLLib. We will end with an exercise you can try yourself for practice  along with my solution to it.

 In this video  we will focus on getting VirtualBox  a Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) sandbox  and the MovieLens data set installed for use in the rest of the series. Your instructor is Frank Kane  who spent nine years at Amazon.com and IMDb.com as a senior engineer and senior manager  wrangling their massive data sets.

COurse Description
The world of Hadoop and ""Big Data"" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course  you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!

Learn and master the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course  taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We'll go way beyond Hadoop itself  and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.

Install and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks and the Ambari UI
Manage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce
Write programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark
Store and query your data with Sqoop  Hive  MySQL  HBase  Cassandra  MongoDB  Drill  Phoenix  and Presto
Design real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem
Learn how your cluster is managed with YARN  Mesos  Zookeeper  Oozie  Zeppelin  and Hue
Handle streaming data in real time with Kafka  Flume  Spark Streaming  Flink  and Storm
Understanding Hadoop is a highly valuable skill for anyone working at companies with large amounts of data.

Almost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way  including Amazon  Ebay  Facebook  Google  LinkedIn  IBM   Spotify  Twitter  and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New York Times uses Hadoop for processing images.

This course is comprehensive  covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises  so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.

You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords  there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines  we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer  I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala  Pig Latin  and Python.

You'll walk away from this course with a real  deep understanding of Hadoop and its associated distributed systems  and you can apply Hadoop to real-world problems. Plus a valuable completion certificate is waiting for you at the end! 

Please note the focus on this course is on application development  not Hadoop administration. Although you will pick up some administration skills along the way.

I hope to see you in the course soon!

-Frank

People upload videos  take pictures on their cell phones  text friends  update their Facebook status  leave comments around the web  click on ads  and so forth. Machines  too  are generating and keeping more and more data.
Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets.

Spark--
A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals  Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs  and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time.

It has a great significance and strong demand to integrate Spark with the extremely rich Python ecosystems to handle challenges in artificial intelligence. In the latest Spark 2.3  some very exciting features were put in  for example: vectorized UDF in PySpark  which leverages Apache Arrow to provide high performance interoperability between Spark and Pandas/Numpy; Image format in dataFrame/dataset  which can improve Spark and TensorFlow (or other deep learning libraries) interoperability; high-efficiency parallel modeling tuning with Spark MLlib  etc. In this talk  we'll share best practice on real use cases and hands-on experiences to illustrate the power of these new features and bring more discussions on this topic.

RDDs are type-safe  but they can be problematic: It's easy to write a suboptimal job  and RDDs are significantly slower in Python than in Scala. DataFrames address some of these problems  and they're much faster  even in Scala; but  DataFrames aren't type-safe  and they're arguably less flexible.

Enter Datasets  a type-safe  object-oriented programming interface that works with the DataFrames API  provide some of the benefits of RDDs  and can be optimized via the Catalyst optimizer.

ABOUT THE TALK:

Structured Streaming is the next generation of distributed  streaming processing in Apache Spark. Developers can write a query written in their language of choice (Scala/Java/Python/R) using powerful high-level APIs (DataFrames / Datasets / SQL) and apply that same query to both static datasets and streaming data. In case of streaming  Spark will automatically create an incremental execution plan that automatically handles late  out-of-order data and ensures end-to-end exactly-once fault-tolerance guarantees.
 
In this practical session  I will walk through a concrete streaming ETL example where – in less than 10 lines – you can read raw  unstructured data from Kafka data  transform it and write it out as a structured table ready for batch and ad-hoc queries on up-to-the-last-minute data. I will give a quick glimpse of advanced features like event-time based aggregations  stream-stream joins and arbitrary stateful operations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhaigpPFBo,"Shuffle in Apache Spark is an intermediate phrase redistributing data across computing units  which has one important primitive that the shuffle data is persisted on local disks. This architecture suffers from some scalability and reliability issues. Moreover  the assumptions of collocated storage do not always hold in today's data centers. The hardware trend is moving to disaggregated storage and compute architecture for better cost efficiency and scalability. To address the issues of Spark shuffle and support disaggregated storage and compute architecture  we implemented a new remote Spark shuffle manager. This new architecture writes shuffle data to a remote cluster with different Hadoop-compatible filesystem backends. Firstly  the failure of compute nodes will no longer cause shuffle data recomputation. Spark executors can also be allocated and recycled dynamically which results in better resource utilization. Secondly  for most customers currently running Spark with collocated storage  it is usually challenging for them to upgrade the disks on every node to latest hardware like NVMe SSD and persistent memory because of cost consideration and system compatibility. With this new shuffle manager  they are free to build a separated cluster storing and serving the shuffle data  leveraging the latest hardware to improve the performance and reliability. Thirdly  in HPC world  more customers are trying Spark as their high performance data analytics tools  while storage and compute in HPC clusters are typically disaggregated. This work will make their life easier. In this talk  we will present an overview of the issues of the current Spark shuffle implementation  the design of new remote shuffle manager  and a performance study of the work.

People upload videos  take pictures on their cell phones  text friends  update their Facebook status  leave comments around the web  click on ads  and so forth. Machines  too  are generating and keeping more and more data.
Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets.

Spark--
A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals  Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs  and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time.

Scalable Monitoring Using Prometheus with Apache Spark - Diane Feddema & Zak Hassan  Red Hat Inc (Intermediate Skill Level)

As spark applications move to a containerized environment  there are many questions about how to best configure server systems in the container world. In this talk we will demonstrate a set of tools to better monitor performance and identify optimal configuration settings. We will demonstrate how Prometheus  a project that is now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)  can be applied to monitor and archive system performance data in a containerized spark environment. In our examples  we will gather spark metric output through Prometheus and present the data with Grafana dashboards. We will use our examples to demonstrate how performance can be enhanced through different tuned configuration settings. Our demo will show how to configure settings across the cluster as well as within each node.

It's the start of a new project and you're excited to apply some machine learning models.

You take a look at the data and quickly realize it's an absolute mess.

According to IBM Data Analytics you can expect to spend up to 80% of your time on a project cleaning data.

There's all different types of messy data  but today we're going to focus on one of the most common  missing values.

We'll take a look at standard types that Pandas recognizes out of the box.

Next we'll take a look at some non-standard types. These are inputs that Pandas won't automatically recognize as missing values.

After that we'll take a look at unexpected types. Let's say you have a column of names that contains a 12  technically that's a missing value.

After we've finished detecting missing values we'll learn how to summarize and do simple replacements.",5,314,352,4.9439774,youtube,"['data cleaning', 'cleaning data', 'data cleaning with python', 'cleaning data with python']",Data Cleaning Tutorial (2018) | Cleaning Data With Python and Pandas,25868,data cleaning

Most of your time is going to involve processing/cleaning/munging data. How do you know your data is clean? Sometimes you know what you need beforehand  but other times you don't. We'll cover the basics of looking at your data and getting started with the Pandas Python library  and then focus on how to ""tidy"" and reshape data. We'll finish with applying customized processing functions on our data.

A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. In fact  it is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data  and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python  from learning how to diagnose your data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course  you'll apply all of the techniques you've learned to a case study in which you'll clean a real-world Gapminder dataset!

So you've just got a brand new dataset and are itching to start exploring it. But where do you begin  and how can you be sure your dataset is clean? This chapter will introduce you to the world of data cleaning in Python! You'll learn how to explore your data with an eye for diagnosing issues such as outliers  missing values  and duplicate rows.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0TfIbZXPeA,"In this video  I will show you 10 simple ways to clean data in Excel.

Data forms the backbone of any analysis that you do in Excel. And when it comes to data  there are tons of things that can go wrong – be it the structure  placement  formatting  extra spaces  and so on.

Excel can be an amazing tool for data analysis. But we hardly get the data that can be used right away. And bad data leads to bad analysis.

Cleaning the raw data that you get in Excel will depend on what type and structure of data you get. There are a lot of things you can do before-hand to make sure your raw data get cleaned and ready for use.

Excel has a lot of formulas and functionalities that can help you clean your data. For example  you can use a formula such as TRIM to clean your data of leading  trailing and double spaces. Or you can use the remove duplicate functionality to remove any occurrence of duplicate records.

The following data cleaning technique are covered in this video:
-- Get Rid of Extra Spaces (leading  trailing  and extra spaces between words)
-- Select and remove All Blank Cells/rows
-- Convert Numbers Stored as Text into Numbers
-- Remove Duplicates cells/records
-- Highlight cells that contain Errors
-- Change Text to Lower/Upper/Proper Case to make it all consistent
-- Spell Check (using a keyboard shortcut)
-- Delete all Formatting
-- Use Find and Replace to Clean Data in Excel

The data cleansing technique covered in this video are some of the most common ones that you can use as soon as you get your raw data. Again  based on your dataset  you may need to add more to it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78JR7XHTro,"In this Excel tutorial  you'll learn how to clean up data using the TRIM  PROPER  and Text to Columns functions (and more).
By http://breakingintowallstreet.com/ ""Financial Modeling Training And Career Resources For Aspiring Investment Bankers""
Why Do You Need to ""Clean Up"" Data? Often you've pasted in data from websites or PDFs or other sources  and you get lots of ugly formatting and other problems  such as extra spaces  non-printable characters  etc.

Also  data may be grouped together in cases where it's better to be separated (as in the address data here).

This happens all the time on the job  and cleaning up the data makes your life easier and makes it 100x easier to manipulate and analyze it.

You COULD go in and manually fix it  but you might want to jump off the roof of a tall building after doing that.

Instead  we'll use these functions to automate the process:

Text Manipulation Formulas (Across all PC and Mac versions):

=TRIM             Remove extra spaces
=PROPER     Makes first letter in each word uppercase
=CLEAN        Removes all non-printable characters from text

=UPPER        Capitalizes all letters in all words     
=LOWER       Turns all letters in all words to lowercase

Alt + A + E / Alt + D + E      Text to Columns
Ctrl + C                                 Copy (CMD + C on the Mac)

Alt + E + S + F                     Paste Formulas (Ctrl + CMD + V  CMD + F on the Mac)
Alt + E + S + V                     Paste Values (Ctrl + CMD + V  CMD + V on the Mac)

Alt + O + C + A                    Auto-Fit Column Width
Alt + H + C + A                    Center Text

How to Clean Up This Data in 5 Steps:

1. First  remove all the extra spaces and capitalize each individual word with TRIM and PROPER - could throw in CLEAN for good measure.

2. Then  separate everything into separate columns with the ""Text to Column"" function.

May have to apply this several times if different characters separate each type of data (commas vs. spaces).

3. Fix anything that still requires fixing in these separate columns - capitalize all state abbreviations  make sure ZIP codes with trailing 0 still work properly (change format to text)  and so on.

May also need to apply additional TRIMs here.

Must be really careful with copying and pasting data as values - have to do that to avoid errors!

4. Add column headers at the top  based on copy and paste of original header.

5. Delete extra rows/columns and shift everything over or up properly.

What Next?

Go apply this to real data that you're working with... depends a bit on the specific problems with the data  but you can never go wrong with TRIM  PROPER  and Text to Columns!

If you're more advanced  you could try automating this entire process with VBA and macros 
but that also gets complicated and may not save you much time since you need to know what the data looks like before writing code for that.",20,830,637,4.8782344,youtube,"['Excel', 'Microsoft Excel', 'Financial Models', 'Excel Shortcuts', 'Cleaning Up Data', 'PROPER', 'TRIM', 'CLEAN', 'Text to Columns', 'Address Data', 'Paste Values', 'Paste Formulas', 'Breaking Into Wall Street', 'Mergers And Inquisitions', 'Excel Model Tutorial', 'Investment', 'excel tutorial', 'ms excel', 'microsoft excel tutorial', 'worksheets', 'financial statements', 'financial modeling', 'balance sheet', 'cash flow statement', 'excel tips', 'excel function', 'excel tricks', 'excel formulas', 'formulas', 'valuation']","Excel Tutorial - Cleaning Up Data with TRIM, PROPER, and Text to Columns",67048,data cleaning

This function works in any version of Excel in Windows and Mac  and also in Google Sheets. It allows you to find data in one table using some identifier it has in common with another table. The two tables can be on different sheets or even on different workbooks. There is also an HLOOKUP function  which does the same thing  but with data arranged horizontally  across rows.

Why Learn Natural Language Processing or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data  like social media  books  newspapers  emails  etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However  using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text  very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language  developed over thousands and thousands of years  has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

Why Learn Natural Language Processing  or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data  like social media  books  newspapers  emails  etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However  using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text  very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language  developed over thousands and thousands of years  has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

Hi  I'm Ted. I'm the instructor for this intro text mining course. Let's kick things off by defining text mining and quickly covering two text mining approaches.

Academic text mining definitions are long  but I prefer a more practical approach. So text mining is simply the process of distilling actionable insights from text. Here we have a satellite image of San Diego overlaid with social media pictures and traffic information for the roads. It is simply too much information to help you navigate around town. This is like a bunch of text that you couldn’t possibly read and organize quickly  like a million tweets or the entire works of Shakespeare. You’re drinking from a firehose! So in this example if you need directions to get around San Diego  you need to reduce the information in the map. Text mining works in the same way. You can text mine a bunch of tweets or of all of Shakespeare to reduce the information just like this map. Reducing the information helps you navigate and draw out the important features.

This is a text mining workflow. After defining your problem statement you transition from an unorganized state to an organized state  finally reaching an insight. In chapter 4  you'll use this in a case study comparing google and amazon.

The text mining workflow can be broken up into 6 distinct components. Each step is important and helps to ensure you have a smooth transition from an unorganized state to an organized state. This helps you stay organized and increases your chances of a meaningful output.

The first step involves problem definition. This lays the foundation for your text mining project. Next is defining the text you will use as your data. As with any analytical project it is important to understand the medium and data integrity because these can effect outcomes. Next you organize the text  maybe by author or chronologically.

Step 4 is feature extraction. This can be calculating sentiment or in our case extracting word tokens into various matrices. Step 5 is to perform some analysis. This course will help show you some basic analytical methods that can be applied to text. Lastly  step 6 is the one in which you hopefully answer your problem questions  reach an insight or conclusion  or in the case of predictive modeling produce an output.

Now let’s learn about two approaches to text mining. The first is semantic parsing based on word syntax. In semantic parsing you care about word type and order. This method creates a lot of features to study. For example a single word can be tagged as part of a sentence  then a noun and also a proper noun or named entity. So that single word has three features associated with it. This effect makes semantic parsing ""feature rich"". To do the tagging  semantic parsing follows a tree structure to continually break up the text.

In contrast  the bag of words method doesn’t care about word type or order. Here  words are just attributes of the document. In this example we parse the sentence ""Steph Curry missed a tough shot"". In the semantic example you see how words are broken down from the sentence  to noun and verb phrases and ultimately into unique attributes.

Bag of words treats each term as just a single token in the sentence no matter the type or order. For this introductory course  we’ll focus on bag of words  but will cover more advanced methods in later courses!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YacOe4XwhY,Hi. In this lecture will transform tokens into features. And the best way to do that is Bag of Words. Let's count occurrences of a particular token in our text. The motivation is the following. We're actually looking for marker words like excellent or disappointed  and we want to detect those words  and make decisions based on absence or presence of that particular word  and how it might work. Let's take an example of three reviews like a good movie  not a good movie  did not like. Let's take all the possible words or tokens that we have in our documents. And for each such token  let's introduce a new feature or column that will correspond to that particular word. So  that is a pretty huge metrics of numbers  and how we translate our text into a vector in that metrics or row in that metrics. So  let's take for example good movie review. We have the word good  which is present in our text. So we put one in the column that corresponds to that word  then comes word movie  and we put one in the second column just to show that that word is actually seen in our text. We don't have any other words  so all the rest are zeroes. And that is a really long vector which is sparse in a sense that it has a lot of zeroes. And for not a good movie  it will have four ones  and all the rest of zeroes and so forth. This process is called text vectorization  because we actually replace the text with a huge vector of numbers  and each dimension of that vector corresponds to a certain token in our database. You can actually see that it has some problems. The first one is that we lose word order  because we can actually shuffle over words  and the representation on the right will stay the same. And that's why it's called bag of words  because it's a bag they're not ordered  and so they can come up in any order. And different problem is that counters are not normalized. Let's solve these two problems  and let's start with preserving some ordering. So how can we do that? Actually you can easily come to an idea that you should look at token pairs  triplets  or different combinations. These approach is also called as extracting n-grams. One gram stands for tokens  two gram stands for a token pair and so forth. So let's look how it might work. We have the same three reviews  and now we don't only have columns that correspond to tokens  but we have also columns that correspond to let's say token pairs. And our good movie review now translates into vector  which has one in a column corresponding to that token pair good movie  for movie for good and so forth. So  this way  we preserve some local word order  and we hope that that will help us to analyze this text better. The problems are obvious though. This representation can have too many features  because let's say you have 100 000 words in your database  and if you try to take the pairs of those words  then you can actually come up with a huge number that can exponentially grow with the number of consecutive words that you want to analyze. So that is a problem. And to overcome that problem  we can actually remove some n-grams. Let's remove n-grams from features based on their occurrence frequency in documents of our corpus. You can actually see that for high frequency n-grams  as well as for low frequency n-grams  we can show why we don't need those n-grams. For high frequency  if you take a text and take high frequency n-grams that is seen in almost all of the documents  and for English language that would be articles  and preposition  and stuff like that. Because they're just there for grammatical structure and they don't have much meaning. These are called stop-words  they won't help us to discriminate texts  and we can pretty easily remove them. Another story is low frequency n-grams  and if you look at low frequency n-grams  you actually find typos because people type with mistakes  or rare n-grams that's usually not seen in any other reviews. And both of them are bad for our model  because if we don't remove these tokens  then very likely we will overfeed  because that would be a very good feature for our future classifier that can just see that  okay  we have a review that has a typo  and we had only like two of those reviews  which had those typo  and it's pretty clear whether it's positive or negative. So  it can learn some independences that are actually not there and we don't really need them. And the last one is medium frequency n-grams  and those are really good n-grams  because they contain n-grams that are not stop-words  that are not typos and we actually look at them. And  the problem is there're a lot of medium frequency n-grams. And it proved to be useful to look at n-gram frequency in our corpus for filtering out bad n-grams. What if we can use the same frequency for ranking of medium frequency n-grams?,5,864,388,4.9491096,youtube,"['Feature Extraction', 'Text Processing', 'NLP', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'by National Research University Higher School of Economics', 'Token', 'Python', 'grams', 'Token pairs']",Feature Extraction from Text (USING PYTHON),23570,text mining

Julia Silge | Text Mining Using Tidy Data Principles

Text data is increasingly important in many domains  and tidy data principles and tidy tools can make text mining easier and more effective. In this talk  Julia will demonstrate how we can manipulate  summarize  and visualize the characteristics of text using these methods and R packages from the tidy tool ecosystem. These tools are highly effective for many analytical questions and allow analysts to integrate natural language processing into effective workflows already in wide use. We will explore how to implement approaches such as sentiment analysis of texts  measuring tf-idf  and building text models.

Today more than ever before  we have access raw data in the form of texts. Businesses around the world store text discussions from their market research  customer care discussions  or brand relevant conversation on social media. While it is clear that texts contain valuable information  it is often less clear on how best texts can be analyzed at scale.

In this class  we will share how we at LinkedIn built a scalable text-mining platform to uncover insights from text data. We will focus on two important components: THEME DISCOVERY of new content and how to CLASSIFY existing text. Using both features  we can detect emerging trends within reviews  customer care discussions and market research data. You will learn:

THEME DISCOVERY - information extraction

Theme recognition is a highly complex task due to the multi-facetted nature of our language. Theme Recognition (without requiring manual reviews) is  however  the main component of any text-mining platform. We will introduce an innovation in information extraction using part of speech tagging (currently patent pending) to uncover themes within textual data.

TEXT CLASSIFICATIONS - Supervised Machine Learning

Another important component of our NLP platform is the ability to classify text via supervised machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM).  The ability to classify serves many business use-cases ranging from sentiment analytics to product identification. You will learn in our talk how to cater to those different requirements via a flexible platform setup.

VALUE of DATA - Member Feedback

The combined ability of Themes Discovery (new content and ideas) as well as Classifications (standard measure) creates a very effective framework to get business insights out of text data. We will demonstrate this on the use case of classifying and responding to member feedback.",2,4191,77,4.8987341,youtube,"['text classification', 'Text Mining (Industry)', 'Data', 'Big Data']",How to build a Text Mining Platform,12853,text mining

TRANSCRIPT OVERVIEW

ALGORITHM

1. Take the full CONTENT and split it into PARAGRAPHS. 

2. Split each PARAGRAPH into SENTENCES. 

3. Compare every sentence with every other. This is done by Counting the number of common words and then Normalize this by dividing by average number of words per sentence.

4. These intermediate scores/values are stored in an INTERSECTION matrix

5. Create the key-value dictionary
 - Key : Sentence
 - Value : Sum of intersection values with this sentence

6. From every paragraph  extract the sentences  with the highest score.

7. Sort the selected sentences in order of appearance in the original text to preserve content and meaning.

And like that  you have generated a summary of the original text.


CLASSES IN JAVA PROJECT

1. Sentence : The entire text is divided into a number of paragraphs and each paragraph is divided into a number of sentences.
2. Paragraph : Every paragraph has a number associated with it and an Array List of sentences. 
3.  Sentence Comparitor : Compare Sentence objects based on Score
4.  SentenceComparatorForSummary  : Compare Sentence objects based on position in text.
5. SummayTool : akes care of all the operations from extracting sentences to generating the summary.


HOW IS MY SUMMARIZER BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ?


My text summarizer selects number of sentences from a paragraph depending on the length. This is an improvement over the original text summarizer implementation that only selects 1 sentence per paragraph regardless of length. So  If the author decides to crunch everything into 1 paragraph  then only one sentence  would  be chosen. In the current implementation  we set it to accept several sentences for larger paragraphs.  It delivers cogent summaries for general essays  reviews and publications.

Natural languages (English  Hindi  Mandarin etc.) are different from programming languages. The semantic or the meaning of a statement depends on the context  tone and a lot of other factors. Unlike programming languages  natural languages are ambiguous.

Text mining deals with helping computers understand the “meaning” of the text. Some of the common text mining applications include sentiment analysis e.g if a Tweet about a movie says something positive or not  text classification e.g classifying the mails you get as spam or ham etc.

In this tutorial  we’ll learn about text mining and use some R libraries to implement some common text mining techniques. We’ll learn how to do sentiment analysis  how to build word clouds  and how to process your text so that you can do meaningful analysis with it.",1,469,92,4.9569893,youtube,"['r programming', 'r programming tutorial', 'data science', 'r language', 'data mining', 'text mining', 'text analysis', 'text analysis tutorial', 'text mining tutorial', 'tm package', 'wordcloud', 'data science tutorial', 'sentiment analysis', 'data', 'text mining with r', 'tm', 'corpus', 'words', 'sentiment score', 'rstats', 'data analysis', 'learn r', 'r tutorial', 'r for data science', 'r for data analysis', 'data analysis tutorial', 'stopwords', 'clean text', 'tm_map', 'lowercase', 'text analytics with r', 'text analytics']",R PROGRAMMING TEXT MINING TUTORIAL,7258,text mining

Some of the key tools of NLP are lemmatization  named entity recognition  POS tagging  syntactic parsing  fact extraction  sentiment analysis  and machine translation. NLP tools typically model the probability that a language component (such as a word  phrase  or fact) will occur in a specific context. An example is the trigram model  which estimates the likelihood that three words will occur in a corpus. While these models can be useful  they have some limitations. Language is subjective  and the same words can convey completely different meanings. Sometimes even synonyms can differ in their precise connotation. NLP applications require manual curation  and this labor contributes to variable quality and consistency.

Deep Learning can be used to overcome some of the limitations of NLP. Unlike traditional methods  Deep Learning does not use the components of natural language directly. Rather  a deep learning approach starts by intelligently mapping each language component to a vector. One particular way to vectorize a word is the “one-hot” representation. Each slot of the vector is a 0 or 1. However  one-hot vectors are extremely big. For example  the Google 1T corpus has a vocabulary with over 13 million words. 

One-hot vectors are often used alongside methods that support dimensionality reduction like the continuous bag of words model (CBOW). The CBOW model attempts to predict some word “w” by examining the set of words that surround it. A shallow neural net of three layers can be used for this task  with the input layer containing one-hot vectors of the surrounding words  and the output layer firing the prediction of the target word.

The skip-gram model performs the reverse task by using the target to predict the surrounding words. In this case  the hidden layer will require fewer nodes since only the target node is used as input. Thus the activations of the hidden layer can be used as a substitute for the target word’s vector.

Two popular tools:
Word2Vec: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/
Glove: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Word vectors can be used as inputs to a deep neural network in applications like syntactic parsing  machine translation  and sentiment analysis. Syntactic parsing can be performed with a recursive neural tensor network  or RNTN. An RNTN consists of a root node and two leaf nodes in a tree structure. Two words are placed into the net as input  with each leaf node receiving one word. The leaf nodes pass these to the root  which processes them and forms an intermediate parse. This process is repeated recursively until every word of the sentence has been input into the net. In practice  the recursion tends to be much more complicated since the RNTN will analyze all possible sub-parses  rather than just the next word in the sentence. As a result  the deep net would be able to analyze and score every possible syntactic parse.

Recurrent nets are a powerful tool for machine translation. These nets work by reading in a sequence of inputs along with a time delay  and producing a sequence of outputs. With enough training  these nets can learn the inherent syntactic and semantic relationships of corpora spanning several human languages. As a result  they can properly map a sequence of words in one language to the proper sequence in another language.

Richard Socher’s Ph.D. thesis included work on the sentiment analysis problem using an RNTN. He introduced the notion that sentiment  like syntax  is hierarchical in nature. This makes intuitive sense  since misplacing a single word can sometimes change the meaning of a sentence. Consider the following sentence  which has been adapted from his thesis:

“He turned around a team otherwise known for overall bad temperament”

In the above example  there are many words with negative sentiment  but the term “turned around” changes the entire sentiment of the sentence from negative to positive. A traditional sentiment analyzer would probably label the sentence as negative given the number of negative terms. However  a well-trained RNTN would be able to interpret the deep structure of the sentence and properly label it as positive.
